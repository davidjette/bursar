# Strategy for CPA Rollup


# Strategy for Acquiring and Scaling HOA-Focused CPA Firms in California (CIRA Market)

## Introduction
This report presents a comprehensive strategy for Bursar to enter and scale in the California homeowners association (HOA) and condominium association accounting niche – formally known as the Common Interest Realty Association (CIRA) market. The plan focuses on acquiring small CPA firms and transforming them into a vertically-specialized practice serving HOAs with financial compilations, reviews, and audits. It outlines key accounting terms, the strategic rationale for targeting the HOA/CIRA niche, an execution roadmap for acquisitions and integration, resource estimates, risk mitigation, and alignment with Bursar’s broader strategy. California is an attractive market given its large and growing number of HOAs (estimated 50,000+ associations statewide, housing over 14 million residents)[1], and state laws that mandate annual financial reviews for most associations. By leveraging these structural drivers and Bursar’s technology platform, we aim to build a scalable, tech-enabled HOA accounting practice as a model for an AI-driven national CPA firm roll-up.

## 1. Definitions of Key Accounting and Audit Terms
Before detailing the strategy, it is important to clarify several professional terms of art in the accounting/audit context that will be used throughout this report:
• Compilation: In a compilation engagement, a CPA organizes financial data into statements without providing any assurance. It is the lowest level of attestation – the CPA simply assembles information provided by management and does not need to be independent (unlike in audits/reviews)[2]. No opinion or verification is provided; the CPA takes minimal responsibility and offers no assurance that the financials comply with GAAP[2]. (In California, HOAs with gross income ≤ $75,000 can opt for a compilation in lieu of a higher-level review or audit[2].)
• Review: A review is a mid-level assurance service in which a CPA performs limited procedures – primarily inquiries and analytical analysis – to provide “limited assurance” that no material modifications are needed for financial statements to be in conformity with GAAP[3]. A review is less extensive than an audit (no examination of internal controls or third-party confirmations) but more robust than a compilation. California’s Civil Code §5305 requires an annual review by an independent CPA for any HOA with gross income over $75,000[3]. Review engagements are governed by the AICPA’s Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS)[3].
• Audit: An audit is the highest level of assurance, involving an extensive examination of financial records, internal controls testing, and third-party confirmations. The CPA conducts the audit under Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) and issues an opinion on whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and comply with GAAP[4]. An audit provides “reasonable assurance” (a high level of confidence) that the statements are materially correct[4]. Audits are far more rigorous (and costly) than reviews or compilations and are generally only required if an HOA’s bylaws demand it or if the board or lenders specifically request one. (Neither an audit nor a review guarantees to detect fraud or embezzlement[5].)
• Agreed-Upon Procedures (AUP): An AUP engagement is a specialized attestation where a CPA performs specific procedures agreed to by the client (and any other specified parties) and reports the factual findings[6]. Unlike an audit or review, the CPA does not provide an overall opinion or assurance in an AUP report – they simply list the procedures performed and the results[7]. AUP engagements are governed by the AICPA’s attestation standards (AT-C §215) and are often used to address targeted concerns (e.g. verifying certain figures or compliance with specific provisions) without undertaking a full audit.
• SSARS (Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services): SSARS are the authoritative standards issued by the AICPA that govern unaudited financial statement services for private companies. These standards apply to preparation, compilation, and review engagements – essentially any service where an audit is not performed[8]. For example, how a CPA conducts a homeowners association review engagement is dictated by SSARS. Compliance with SSARS ensures consistency and quality in compilation and review reports across the profession.
• GAAS (Generally Accepted Auditing Standards): GAAS refers to the professional auditing standards that auditors must follow when performing an audit of financial statements. In the U.S., GAAS are promulgated by the AICPA’s Auditing Standards Board (for private entities) and are the benchmark against which audit quality is judged[9]. GAAS encompasses fundamental principles for auditor qualifications, fieldwork, and reporting. All HOA audits performed in this strategy must adhere to GAAS to ensure work quality and compliance with California Board of Accountancy regulations.
• Independence Impairment: “Independence” means the CPA has no disqualifying financial, familial, or managerial relationship with the client – it’s a cornerstone requirement for audits and reviews. An independence impairment occurs when the CPA’s objectivity is compromised (for example, the CPA or staff has a direct financial interest in the HOA, serves on its board, or is an HOA member). In such cases the CPA is not independent and thus cannot perform an audit or review under professional standards. (Notably, independence is not required for compilation engagements[2] – if a CPA’s independence is impaired, they may still issue a compilation report, but must disclose the lack of independence in the report.) Bursar’s practice will implement strict policies to identify and avoid independence impairments (see Execution Roadmap).
• ASC 972: ASC 972 “Real Estate – Common Interest Realty Associations” is the section of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification that provides specific accounting guidance for HOAs and similar community associations[10]. ASC 972 outlines how such associations should recognize member assessments, account for common property, handle reserve funds, etc. Understanding ASC 972 is critical when preparing HOA financial statements in accordance with GAAP, as it addresses the unique aspects of association accounting (e.g. fund for major repairs and replacements). Our HOA-focused teams will need expertise in ASC 972 to ensure financial reports meet industry standards.
• Peer Review: In public accounting, “peer review” is a mandatory quality assurance program for firms performing attest services (audits, reviews, and certain compilations). Under AICPA and California Board of Accountancy rules, any CPA firm that issues audit, review, or compilation reports for third-party use must undergo a peer review (typically every 3 years)[11]. In a peer review, an independent CPA firm examines the firm’s workpapers and quality control system to verify compliance with professional standards. Successfully passing peer reviews will be essential as Bursar scales an HOA audit/review practice – it ensures our engagements meet GAAS/SSARS and helps maintain our license to practice. We will enroll all acquired firms in the AICPA Peer Review Program and uphold rigorous quality control to excel in these reviews.

## 2. Strategic Rationale for Entering the California HOA/CIRA Niche
Entering the HOA/CIRA-focused assurance market in California offers compelling strategic benefits for Bursar. Below, we outline the rationale – from built-in demand drivers to market dynamics – that make this niche attractive and scalable:
• Built-In Demand via Statutory Requirements: California’s Davis-Stirling Act (Civil Code §5305) effectively guarantees a baseline demand for CPA services among HOAs. Any community association with annual gross income over $75,000 must obtain an annual independent financial review by a CPA and distribute it to members within 120 days of year-end[3]. Smaller HOAs (≤$75K income) can opt for a compilation instead[2]. In practice, this means thousands of HOAs are legally required to engage a CPA every year. This statutory requirement creates a steady, non-cyclical book of business focused on reviews (with some compilations for the smallest HOAs). By specializing in this niche, Bursar taps into a recurring revenue stream mandated by law – a strong foundation for growth.
• Market Size and Growth: California is the nation’s largest HOA market with an estimated 50,000+ HOAs of all types (condominium associations, planned unit developments, co-ops, etc.)[1]. Over 4.7 million housing units in the state are in HOA communities[12], and roughly one-third of Californians live in an HOA. This industry has expanded steadily as common-interest developments remain a preferred model for housing. The sheer volume of associations – and new ones formed each year – provides a large addressable client base. Even at small penetration rates, a focused firm can accumulate hundreds of HOA clients. Moreover, HOAs tend to remain in operation in perpetuity (housing doesn’t go away), and new associations are created with each condo/townhome development, indicating a growing market over time. This growth underpins a long-term expansion opportunity for a firm dedicated to HOA services.
• Service Mix Oriented to Reviews (Scalable Work): Most California HOAs will fall into doing annual reviews or compilations, with full audits being the exception. Audits are only required if an HOA’s governing documents specifically mandate one or if a board proactively chooses an audit (for added assurance or due to lender requests). In fact, audits are discretionary unless required by bylaws[13]. Because reviews satisfy the legal requirement at a lower cost, the vast majority of associations opt for reviews annually, not audits. This is strategically favorable for Bursar: review and compilation engagements are more scalable than audits. They involve fewer hours and lower risk per engagement, allowing a well-trained staff to handle large volumes with standardized workflows. Audits, by contrast, are labor-intensive, require highly experienced personnel on-site, and carry higher legal exposure – thus harder to scale. By building our service model around the bread-and-butter review engagements (and compilation for very small clients), we maximize recurring workload that can be systematized and delivered efficiently. We will certainly offer audits when needed, but from a growth perspective, reviews and compilations will be our high-volume, repeatable services.
• Favorable Economics: Lower Cost, Higher Volume Services: Related to the above, reviews/compilations come with less onerous work requirements and lower liability, meaning we can leverage junior accountants and technology more heavily in their execution. HOAs also prefer them due to cost: for example, state guidelines suggest a typical HOA financial review might cost around $1,200+ per year for a small-to-midsize association, whereas a full audit can start at $1,800–$4,500 and scale much higher for large communities[14]. In practice, HOA audits often cost 4–8 times more than a review for the same client[15], owing to the extra procedures. As a result, many associations only commission audits in special situations (e.g. suspected fraud or loan compliance), and stick with yearly reviews for routine compliance. This dynamic lets us capture a broad client base at the review level, generating revenue with relatively lower hours per engagement. Those economics (more engagements at moderate fees, rather than a few big audits) align well with a tech-enabled scaling strategy – we can deploy automation to handle repetitive review tasks and service a high volume of HOA clients profitably.
• Legal and Financial Environment Driving Need for Expertise: HOAs are facing increasing financial scrutiny and complexity, which drives demand for specialized accounting support:
• California Law Shapes Demand: Beyond the $75K review mandate, various regulations ensure HOAs must maintain transparency and adequate reserves. For instance, Civil Code §5300 requires HOAs to prepare annual budgets, policy statements, and reserve funding disclosures. Upcoming laws (like SB 326 requiring structural balcony inspections for condo buildings) force associations to plan for major repairs. As compliance burdens grow, boards lean on CPAs to ensure financial statements and reserve reports are accurate and to navigate reporting rules. California’s robust HOA statutes essentially make having a knowledgeable HOA-specialist CPA part of good governance.
• Aging Buildings & Capital Projects: A large portion of California’s condos and HOAs were built in the 1970s–1990s and are now decades old. These aging properties increasingly require major capital repairs or replacements (roofing, elevators, plumbing, structural components). Many associations have under-funded reserve accounts and will need to levy special assessments or obtain loans to finance these projects[16]. Lenders often ask for CPA-prepared financials (sometimes audits) when HOAs apply for loans. Even without financing, boards in aging communities may request enhanced financial reviews or agreed-upon procedures to ensure funds are handled properly during large projects. The surge in big capital expenditures places greater emphasis on accurate financial reporting, budgeting and oversight, elevating the role of the HOA CPA as a key advisor.
• Board Turnover & Volunteer Management: HOA boards consist of volunteer homeowners who typically rotate frequently (annual elections or burnout lead to turnover). New board members – often with limited financial background – inherit responsibility for budgets and financial statements they did not create. This creates an ongoing need for independent financial expertise and continuity. A specialist CPA firm can provide that continuity year over year, giving the board and owners confidence that an independent professional is reviewing the books regardless of who is on the board. Frequent board turnover actually increases reliance on external accountants: each new treasurer or president may be inclined to “get an outside review” for peace of mind. Additionally, some HOA boards unfortunately lack financial savvy or even engage in poor practices (e.g. keeping dues artificially low, deferring maintenance)[17] – having a reputable CPA issue reports can help impose discipline or at least highlight financial realities to all members. In short, the human factor in HOAs (untrained volunteers, personality dynamics, even occasional embezzlement cases) makes a strong case for an independent firm to be regularly involved.
• Demographic & Housing Trends: California continues to develop housing in the form of common-interest communities (condos, townhomes, planned communities) especially in urban and suburban infill projects. Meanwhile, existing associations are growing in financial complexity as property values and budgets increase. HOAs often manage hundreds of thousands to multi-millions of dollars in annual assessments. There is a heightened awareness post-Florida Surfside tragedy and other incidents that HOA boards must exercise diligence in maintenance and finances. The result is a trend toward more proactive financial management – boards and owners are more likely now to insist on clear, externally-reviewed financials and adequate reserve funding. All these factors support a robust and possibly expanding market for HOA-focused assurance services in California.
In summary, the California HOA/CIRA niche offers a large, growing, and structurally supported client base for assurance services. The work predominantly consists of recurring reviews and compilations (ideal for process efficiency and technology leverage), with periodic audits or special engagements as needed. The combination of regulatory mandate, demographic drivers, and the opportunity to apply automation to a high-volume service makes this vertical attractive for Bursar’s acquisition and scaling strategy. It’s a chance to build a highly defensible specialty practice with steady revenue and clear expansion potential.

## 3. Execution Roadmap for Acquisition and Scaling
To capitalize on this opportunity, we propose a step-by-step execution roadmap. The plan begins with acquiring a small CPA firm as a foothold and then scaling up through additional acquisitions and an integrated platform approach. Key steps include establishing a compliant ownership structure, standardizing services, automating workflows, and ensuring quality controls. Below is the roadmap with major actions:
• Step 1: Targeted Acquisition of a Foundation Firm (Months 0–3). We will identify and acquire an initial California CPA firm with <$2M in annual revenue that has a toehold in HOA accounting. The ideal first acquisition is a generalist firm that already serves a handful of HOA/condo association clients (providing compilations/reviews) but lacks deep specialization. Such a firm likely has an aging owner looking to sell/retire, providing an entry at a reasonable valuation (around 1.0–1.2× revenue). By acquiring a going concern, we obtain an existing client base (including their HOA clients) and a team of staff familiar with basic HOA engagements. This first firm will serve as the “anchor practice” in California upon which we will build our HOA vertical. Due diligence will focus on client retention risk (ensuring key HOA clients will stay post-sale), the firm’s peer review history (clean peer review reports are a must), and the openness of the staff/partners to adopting new technology and processes. We expect to execute the acquisition and transition the owner to a short-term consulting role within the first 3–4 months.
• Step 2: Implement Dual-Entity Bursar Structure for Ownership and Operations. Immediately upon acquisition, we will reorganize the practice using Bursar’s alternative practice structure. This means operating via two entities:
• a CPA-owned professional firm (let’s call it “Bursar HOA Assurance, CPAs”), which will be at least 51% owned by licensed CPAs (including any retained partners and new CPA leadership). This entity will be registered with the California Board of Accountancy and will legally provide the attest services (audits, reviews, compilations) and tax engagements.
• a Bursar Platform Company (non-CPA-owned) which will house the technology, non-attest services, and support staff. This second entity (owned by Bursar investors) enters a services agreement with the CPA firm to provide all the non-regulated support: staff leasing, software, marketing, admin, and financing.
This dual-entity structure complies with California’s ownership rules (which cap non-CPA ownership of CPA firms at 49%[18]) while still enabling Bursar to inject capital and technology. In practice, the acquired firm’s practice will be contributed to the licensed CPA entity, and the Bursar platform will charge that entity a management fee for services. We will also centralize certain back-office functions immediately under the platform company (client billing, payroll, IT support) to start realizing efficiencies. Importantly, the client experience remains with the CPA firm: client contracts and reports are in the name of the CPA firm, preserving compliance with attest regulations, whereas software tools and perhaps engagement letter language can note the involvement of our affiliate for support. Standing up this structure will involve legal registrations, new operating agreements, and likely re-branding the firm as a Bursar company. We anticipate completing the structural reorganization in the first 1–2 months post-acquisition, so that new engagements (e.g. the upcoming audit/review cycle) are executed under the new model.
• Step 3: Install Leadership and Staff – “CPA Lead” and Team Composition. We will appoint a CPA Lead (Managing Partner) to head the HOA practice – ideally a highly experienced audit/review CPA (either the seller who stays on, or a new hire with HOA/CIRA expertise). This person assumes the role of firm licensee, ensuring we have a responsible individual for signing reports and upholding independence. Under them, we will staff 2–4 accountants who will focus on compilations and reviews:
• Likely one Audit/Review Manager (CPA) who can oversee engagement quality, perform final reviews, and manage client communication for larger clients.
• 1–3 Staff Accountants/Associates who handle the detailed work of preparing financial statements, performing review procedures, and compiling client information. These may be junior CPAs or CPA candidates trained in HOA accounting specifics.
• We will outsource or subcontract tax preparation for HOA returns (Form 1120-H or 1120) to a specialized tax accountant on a part-time basis, rather than hire a full-time tax CPA initially. HOA corporate tax filings are relatively straightforward but must be done annually; outsourcing ensures efficiency until the volume demands an in-house tax person.
• Shared administrative support will be provided through Bursar’s platform team – e.g. a centralized admin can handle engagement letters, scheduling, confirmations, and report delivery for multiple acquired firms, removing the need for each firm to have its own full admin staff.
The idea is to keep the initial team lean but capable: approximately 4–6 FTEs (full-time equivalents) including the partner, accounting staff, and partial admin/tax support. This team should comfortably service the existing clients and take on new ones. As we acquire additional firms (in later steps) or grow the client base, we will add staff accordingly, but also cross-utilize personnel across offices via the platform company. Bursar will also invest in training the team on our standardized workpapers, software, and HOA-specific GAAP (ASC 972) to build subject matter expertise rapidly.
• Step 4: Standardize Service Offerings and Tiers. A crucial part of scaling is to productize our services for HOAs. We will develop three standard service tiers, which every acquired firm/practice will offer uniformly:
• Compilation Tier: Basic annual financial statement compilation plus related deliverables. This service includes compiling the HOA’s balance sheet and income statement from their books, with no assurance, and providing any required supplemental schedules (e.g. comparative budget vs actual reports, or notes on reserves if requested). We will bundle in the preparation of state and federal tax returns at this tier for convenience, and offer to attend the annual board meeting to present the financial report if the client desires (as a value-add). This tier targets small associations (those under the $75k threshold or those just seeking minimal services). It’s priced competitively as an entry-level package.
• Review Tier: The core offering for most clients – an annual CPA review engagement with limited assurance, performed under SSARS. This includes the reviewed financial statements with a CPA’s independent report, plus required communication to the board. We will standardize inclusion of certain “board-friendly” deliverables with the review: e.g. a management letter highlighting any issues noted, a variance analysis report (budget vs actual results for the year), and perhaps a recommended contributions-to-reserve calculation based on the reserve study (to demonstrate value beyond compliance). The review tier can also include the tax return prep and an offer to meet with the board or finance committee. Essentially this is a comprehensive annual financial check-up for mid-sized and large HOAs, fulfilling the legal requirement. We expect this to be our highest-volume service.
• Audit Tier: A full GAAS audit of the HOA’s financials with an opinion. This will be offered to larger associations or those that require it (e.g. by bylaws or lender). The audit tier would encompass the audited financial statements, all standard audit communications (internal control letter if needed), and any agreed-upon additional procedures (for example, if a board wants certain accounts scrutinized in depth). Because audits carry higher risk, we will price these at a premium and only undertake them for select clients that fit our risk profile. Part of standardizing the audit service will be setting acceptance criteria – for instance, we may decide not to audit extremely large master associations (due to liability and capacity constraints) or those with known governance problems, at least in early years. When we do perform an audit, we will likely bundle the tax prep and perhaps a few complementary consulting items (like a governance checklist or fraud prevention advisory) to differentiate our offering as value-rich.
In addition to the financial statement services above, we plan to cross-sell other compliance and consulting services around these tiers: - Tax Filings: Ensure every HOA client, even review-only ones, also engages us for their annual tax return (Form 1120-H or 1120) and related filings. This is a simple add-on sale that complements the financial statement work. - Reserve Certification / Lender Letters: Often lenders or statutes require a CPA letter about whether the HOA’s reserves are per statutory requirements or if any deficiencies exist. We can develop a standard agreed-upon procedure or certification product for this need and sell it alongside audits/reviews. - Board Training and Advisory: Using Bursar’s platform resources, we might offer periodic financial workshops for HOA board members (teaching reading financials, budgeting, etc.), either as a free value-add for clients or a small fee service. This deepens client relationships and showcases our niche expertise. - Controller/CFO Services for HOAs: While we do need to be careful with independence (we cannot manage an HOA’s finances if we also audit/review them), for those associations where we only perform non-attest services (or perhaps for management companies), we could offer bookkeeping, accounting software setup, or controller-for-hire services through the non-CPA entity. This would diversify revenue (though we would firewall such services to avoid independence conflicts with our attest clients).
By standardizing services and deliverables, we ensure every acquired firm is offering a consistent “Bursar HOA Package”. This not only aids in marketing (clear, tiered offerings) but also facilitates process automation – since each tier has defined worksteps and outputs, we can build uniform workflows and templates that every office uses. It turns what used to be bespoke engagements into repeatable products.
• Step 5: Automate High-Friction Workflows with Technology. To truly scale and improve margins, Bursar will aggressively implement technology to automate and streamline the most time-consuming aspects of HOA engagements. Early initiatives include:
• Client PBC Collection: “PBC” (Provided By Client) refers to all the documents and data we ask from the client to perform a review or audit (e.g. bank statements, check registers, invoices for expenses, board minutes, etc.). We will deploy a secure client portal (or leverage an existing tool like Suralink or Box with structured request lists) for HOAs to upload their financial documents. This portal will contain a standard PBC checklist tailored to HOA engagements (e.g. asking for the general ledger, budget, reserve study, bank reconciliations, etc.). The aim is to eliminate the back-and-forth of email and paper. We can also explore direct integrations: for instance, if an HOA’s books are on QuickBooks Online or a property management accounting system (like CINC, AppFolio, Yardi), Bursar’s tech team can build connectors or use APIs to pull trial balances and transactions directly into our workpaper system.
• Bank Reconciliation and Tie-Out Automation: A key audit/review procedure is verifying that bank statement balances tie to the reported cash in financials. We will use software to automate bank tie-outs – possibly using tools that fetch bank statement data (with client permission) and compare to the general ledger. Even simpler, we might use data import and formulas in our workpapers to quickly flag any reconciling differences, rather than do this manually.
• Analytical Review & Variance Analysis: For reviews, much of the work is performing analytics (e.g. comparing current year and prior year balances, or actual vs budget, and inquiring about variances). We can automate the generation of these analytical reports. For example, using an AI-enabled tool or scripts, we can generate a budget vs actual schedule with variance percentages and even initial auto-generated explanations if data is available (or at least highlight which accounts changed the most). This not only saves staff time, but produces a deliverable that can be given to boards. We will create a standardized “Analytical Review Memo” each year that documents our analysis of the HOA’s results – much of which can be populated automatically from the trial balance and prior data.
• Financial Statement Preparation: We plan to implement a “financial statement factory” approach – using either off-the-shelf software (such as Thomson Reuters Engagement or CaseWare) or a custom template – to quickly turn client data into formatted financial statements. For instance, once the trial balance is finalized, we want to auto-generate the HOA’s financial statements with footnotes in compliance with ASC 972. There are known templates for HOA financials (covering fund accounting for operating and reserve funds, etc.), which we can standardize. By automating formatting and using linked data, we reduce partner time spent on drafting statements.
• Workpaper Standardization & Knowledge Capture: We will likely invest in a cloud-based workpaper management system (such as Thomson Reuters AdvanceFlow, Wolters Kluwer CCH Engagement, or a tailored solution) where all engagement workpapers follow a consistent index (based on PPC’s practice aids for CIRA audits, for example). Over time, as we accumulate many engagements, we can train an AI or use algorithms to compare current year figures to prior years or to industry benchmarks, flagging outliers for the auditor’s attention. While this is more advanced, the long-term vision is an “AI co-pilot” for HOA audits and reviews that assists the human auditors by highlighting anomalies (e.g. a sudden jump in repair expenses or a low reserve balance relative to peers) so that we can focus inquiry there. This aligns with Bursar’s thesis of an “AI-native” accounting platform.
• Integration with Property Management Systems: Many HOAs use management companies that keep the accounting records. We will seek partnerships or API integrations with common HOA management software (for example, CINC Systems, HOA Accounting Services, Yardi Condo Manager) so that our auditors can directly obtain read-only access to general ledgers and financial reports. This speeds up the process and can even enable continuous monitoring if we later offer that service.
By attacking these high-friction points with automation, we expect to improve efficiency (more engagements per staff) and also deliver a smoother client experience (less hassle providing documents, faster turnaround). Initially, we will prioritize automation that has immediate payoff, like the client portal and standardized templates, and later incorporate more sophisticated AI tools as we develop them on the Bursar platform side.
• Step 6: Independence Screening Protocols and Quality Control. Given the nature of this niche, we must institute rigorous independence and quality controls from the outset:
• We will maintain a centralized independence database of all HOA clients and all professional staff addresses and affiliations. Before staff are assigned to an engagement, we will check that none live in or own property in the client HOA, and that none have personal relationships (e.g. a family member on the HOA board). For example, if one of our accountants happens to live in “Sunset Villas HOA” and that HOA becomes a client, that staffer cannot work on that review (and depending on significance, we might not accept the engagement at all due to independence rules). These screenings will be part of acceptance and annual conflict-of-interest questionnaires staff will fill out. In high-density regions, it’s quite possible our employees themselves are HOA homeowners – so this protocol is essential to avoid independence impairments.
• Peer Review readiness: From day one, we will implement workpaper and documentation standards anticipating our AICPA peer review. This means using checklists (possibly PPC’s HOA audit/review checklists) to ensure we cover all required procedures, and having a second CPA review each attest report before issuance (an internal quality review process). We intend to enroll in the AICPA Peer Review program as soon as required and will target a pass rating. Strong quality control not only mitigates regulatory risk but also is a selling point to clients (trust that we follow professional standards diligently).
• Client acceptance criteria: We will develop criteria to screen potential HOA clients for risk. Factors such as: is the HOA involved in significant litigation? Are they in financial distress or have signs of fraud? Is there frequent board/management turnover indicating instability? We prefer to onboard stable, well-run associations to reduce the chance of unpleasant surprises or lawsuits. Part of mitigating litigation risk (see Risk Factors section) is choosing our clients wisely. If an HOA shows red flags (for instance, a history of suing their auditors or a chaotic bookkeeping situation), we may decline or only agree to a lesser service (like a compilation or AUP) until they straighten out. This selective approach will protect us as we scale.
• Regional staffing strategy: As we acquire multiple firms, we will cross-train staff on engagements across offices. This not only balances workload but also provides backup if a conflict arises (e.g. if one office has an independence conflict with a client, a staffer from another region who has no such conflict can perform the work). It also helps for succession planning – no single engagement is only understood by one person. We’ll foster a “one firm” culture across Bursar’s HOA practice to enable sharing of personnel and knowledge seamlessly.
• Step 7: Growth via Further Acquisitions (Months 6–18). With the first firm integrated and processes in place, we will pursue additional bolt-on acquisitions to rapidly scale our HOA footprint in California:
• We aim to acquire 2–3 firms within 18 months, focusing on small CPA practices (revenues in the $1M–$3M range) in target regions with high HOA density (e.g. Southern California/Los Angeles, the Bay Area, San Diego, Orange County). Each acquisition will undergo the same playbook – migrate to our dual-entity structure, implement standardized HOA service lines, and integrate staff into our platform and methodology.
• A key element is that each acquired firm does not need to be 100% HOA-focused initially; it might have a mixed client base (individual taxes, small businesses, etc.). We will “carve out” and prioritize the HOA portion (possibly transferring non-HOA clients elsewhere over time or servicing them through a separate team). Eventually, as volume grows, we can consolidate all HOA work under a specialized division and decide how to handle the non-HOA work (some could be cross-sold other services or spun off). The acquisitions, however, are primarily a means to acquire HOA clients and experienced staff quickly, rather than growing one client at a time.
• We will utilize SBA financing and seller notes to fund these acquisitions (see Section 4: Resources/Budget). The strategy is to minimize upfront equity outlay by leveraging the predictable cashflows of these firms. By month 18, we expect to have a network of 2–3 offices in California under the Bursar HOA umbrella, collectively serving perhaps 100+ HOA clients in total. This scale will give us more clout in the market (references, reputation) and also more data to fuel our technology improvements.
• Post-acquisition integration plans include unifying branding (likely all firms will carry the Bursar name eventually, to present a coherent image to larger clients like management companies or lenders), pooling marketing (central website/SEO for HOA accounting in CA), and creating a unified sales strategy (e.g. attending CAI – Community Associations Institute – events, partnering with HOA law firms to get referrals). The ultimate goal is to become California’s leading CPA firm for HOAs/CIRAs in this revenue segment, which we can then leverage when expanding nationally.
• Step 8: Cross-Sell and Deepen Client Relationships. With a solid client base, we will focus on increasing our “share of wallet” and value-add to HOA clients:
• We will cross-sell tax and compliance services Every HOA that we review or audit should also hire us for tax preparation (if not already). We can also handle related compliance filings (like the HOA’s State of California Statement of Information, if they need help with that, or required annual reports to members under Davis-Stirling).
• Services to individual board members: While respecting independence, we can offer personal tax or wealth planning services to board members or property managers we meet through the HOA engagements (via the Bursar platform or sister firms). Board members are often affluent homeowners – their businesses and personal finances might need a CPA. We will tread carefully (to avoid any conflicts of interest), but for example, if a board member is so impressed with our work that they want to move their company’s accounting work to us, that can be channeled to another team within Bursar that handles private business clients. This way, our HOA niche can be a door-opener to other opportunities for the broader firm.
• Advisory on Reserve Funding & Loans: As we gain trust, HOAs will likely seek our guidance on financial management. We can package advisory services such as reserve study analysis (in conjunction with reserve study specialists), guidance on special assessment structuring, or assistance preparing loan packages for bank financing. These are consulting engagements (non-attest) we can run through the Bursar platform. They not only generate additional revenue but also strengthen the client relationship beyond the annual compliance engagement.
• Leverage Client Network Effects: HOAs often communicate with each other (through management companies or industry groups). Satisfied clients will be our best marketing. We’ll encourage referrals and possibly develop referral channels with HOA management firms (who often suggest CPAs to the boards). Over time, our presence in certain regions could become self-reinforcing: e.g. if we service five HOAs managed by the same management company, that company may start referring all their client HOAs to us. Our execution roadmap thus includes a focus on client satisfaction and proactive networking in the HOA community.
By following this execution roadmap, Bursar will create a scalable “assembly line” for HOA audits and reviews, while also building out the infrastructure (staff, tech, procedures) that can handle rapid growth. The phased approach (acquire, integrate, standardize, automate, then acquire more) ensures we don’t compromise quality as we scale. Each step lays the groundwork for the next, transforming initially small firms into a unified, technology-driven HOA accounting powerhouse.

## 4. Resource Requirements and Timeline Estimates
Implementing the above plan will require careful allocation of human, technological, and financial resources. Below we detail the expected resources needed, the timeline to execute key phases, and the budget considerations:
Staffing Plan: The initial and ongoing staffing needs are modest relative to the revenue, due to the efficiency gains from specialization and tech integration. For the first acquisition (~$2M revenue), we plan for:
• CPA Leadership: 1 CPA Partner/Director to act as the signatory and practice leader. This could be the selling owner we retain or a newly hired experienced HOA CPA. They ensure engagements are completed according to standards and mentor the team.
• Audit/Review Staff: 2–4 accountants who will perform the bulk of compilations and reviews. In practice, Year 1 might include one audit manager and two staff accountants, then scale up to more staff as volume grows. We anticipate each experienced staff can handle, say, 20–30 review engagements per year (with support), so a team of this size could cover 50+ HOA clients easily.
• Tax and Specialty Support: Rather than immediately hire full-time tax professionals, we will use outsourced tax prep (e.g. contract with a tax CPA or utilize Bursar’s central tax team) for preparing HOA tax returns, which are seasonal (due in March/April each year). One tax preparer can handle hundreds of HOA returns since they are simpler than individual returns (HOAs often file Form 1120-H with standard elections). Additionally, any IT or advanced analytics personnel will be part of the Bursar platform team and allocated as needed (e.g. a part-time data engineer to set up integrations).
• Administrative/Clerical: We will share admin resources across firms via the platform. For example, one admin person can support multiple offices in scheduling, billing, report assembly, freeing CPAs to focus on client work. Eventually, as we scale to 3+ firms, we might create a small centralized admin team (2–3 people) that handle all HOA practice admin tasks.
This lean staffing approach, enabled by tech, should suffice until we grow the client base substantially. We will monitor workload and plan to hire or acquire additional staff proactively to avoid overloading the team (see Risk section on capacity planning). Table 1 below summarizes the core team roles and counts:
[table]
  | Role | Count (Initial) | Responsibilities |
  | Managing CPA (Partner/Director) | 1 | Lead firm, sign reports, client relationships, ensure quality control. |
  | Audit/Review Manager (CPA) | 1 | Oversee engagements, review workpapers, coach staff, liaise with clients for fieldwork. |
  | Staff Accountants (Audit/Review) | 2–3 (to start) | Perform compilations and reviews, prepare FS drafts, conduct procedures under manager supervision. |
  | Outsourced Tax Preparer | Contracted (≈0.5 FTE equivalent) | Prepare HOA tax returns and filings; engaged during tax season or as needed. |
  | Administrative Support | Shared (centralized) | Handle scheduling, confirmations, report binding/distribution, billing, and other clerical tasks across the practice. |
As the practice grows to multiple locations and ~100+ clients, we expect to increase accounting staff proportionally (e.g. add another partner or senior manager and more juniors) but maintain a relatively flat org structure to stay agile. The Bursar platform will provide additional bench depth by sharing staff among offices during peak periods.
Technology and Software: A robust software stack is critical for efficiency and consistency. We will allocate budget for the following tools and systems:
• Audit/Engagement Management Software: We plan to use a cloud-based audit management system (such as Thomson Reuters Checkpoint Engage, CCH Axcess Engagement, or CaseWare Cloud) to store workpapers, track review notes, and ensure standardization. This will come with built-in templates (potentially including CIRA-specific programs) that we will customize.
• Financial Statement Generation: If not using the above for statements, we may invest in a solution like CaseWare Financials or Jetpack Workflow’s FS module to automate statement production. Alternatively, a well-designed Excel template with macros could suffice initially – the key is consistent formatting (in accordance with ASC 972) and the ability to roll-forward year to year.
• Client Portal: We will either build or subscribe to a client document portal. Budget is set aside for a platform like Suralink, Liscio, or ShareFile, which provides PBC request lists and secure file exchange. This is important for client experience and internal tracking of provided documents.
• Data Integration Tools: To pull data from client accounting systems, we might use a combination of APIs and RPA (robotic process automation). The budget includes some development cost for integrating QuickBooks Online (very common for self-managed HOAs) via API, and possibly RPA bots for systems without APIs (emulating user download of reports). We may also use accounting export tools like Trial Balance export software that some HOA management programs provide.
• Analytics and AI: We will utilize tools like Power BI or Tableau (for creating interactive budget vs actual dashboards and trend analysis for clients) and experiment with AI audit tools (e.g. MindBridge for anomaly detection, though sized for larger data sets, it could be applied to flag unusual transactions if we get raw data). The cost of these might be under the platform R&D budget. Initially, basic Excel analytics with some scripting will cover needs; AI tools can be layered in as we gather more data.
• Practice Management: A unified CRM and practice management software (like practice ignition or Karbon) will be used to manage proposals, engagements, due dates, and billing across our HOA clients. This ensures we don’t miss any statutory deadlines (e.g. the 120-day post-year-end distribution requirement). This system will also help track client details such as fiscal year-ends, board contacts, etc.
• Peer Review and QC Resources: We will subscribe to PPC’s Guides or similar accounting guides for reference (the PPC HOA/CIRA Guide, if available, for audit programs and checklists). These are low-cost but high-value knowledge resources to bolster our quality.
We anticipate an upfront investment in software and IT integration of around $50k–$100k for the first year (for licenses, setup, and possible development work) and ongoing annual costs in the tens of thousands as we add more users and tools. Notably, these technology costs are relatively small compared to labor – and the ROI in saved hours and higher capacity is expected to be high.
Timeline: We project the following timeline for execution milestones:
• Months 0–3: Complete first acquisition (target identification, LOI, closing) and immediate integration steps (rebranding, dual-entity setup, retaining key staff). Begin implementing standardized workflows and introduce client portal to existing clients in time for upcoming year-end engagements.
• Months 3–6: First acquired firm operates under new model through one financial cycle – use this period to refine our processes during the spring “busy season” of audits/reviews and tax filings. Evaluate what worked and where adjustments are needed. Meanwhile, pipeline development for next acquisitions begins (identifying and negotiating with Firm #2, #3).
• Months 6–12: Execute one or two additional acquisitions (likely one around month ~6–8, another by month ~12). Integrate those firms in quick succession, leveraging playbooks from the first integration. By the end of Year 1, aim to have at least 2 firms acquired and integrated, with combined revenue around $3–4M, and a clear unified service offering. Also by this time, key automation (client portal, standardized workpapers, etc.) should be fully in use across all teams.
• Months 13–18: Complete any remaining acquisitions (possibly a third if not done earlier), reaching our target of 2–3 firms total. Focus on scaling up marketing and client acquisition now that infrastructure is in place – try to grow organic client count by cross-selling and referrals. Aim to double the HOA client count through both M&A and organic growth in this period. Internally, begin preparing for a peer review (if in year 2) by conducting internal inspections.
• Month 18 and beyond: With the California HOA practice robust, we would start exploring expansion to other geographies (perhaps other Sunbelt states with high HOAs) as part of Bursar’s national roll-up, using the California operation’s success as a template. Additionally, continue iterating on Bursar’s software platform with lessons learned (maybe even develop proprietary HOA audit software if justified).
In sum, we expect the initial build-out phase to take ~18 months to achieve a strong regional presence. This timeline is aggressive but feasible with sufficient focus and capital.
Budget and Capital Requirements: Acquiring and scaling these firms will require capital primarily for acquisitions and working capital/tech investment. We estimate:
• Acquisition Costs: We have earmarked up to $5 million in total investment to acquire 2–3 firms. At a valuation of roughly 0–1.2× annual revenue, this budget could acquire approximately $4–5M in combined revenue. For example, a firm with $2M revenue might be acquired for ~$2.2M (assuming 1.1×) and a smaller firm with $1.5M revenue for ~$1.65M, totaling ~$3.85M. We include buffer for a third smaller buy or slight premium for a highly strategic target. The purchase price will likely be paid partly upfront and partly as an earn-out or seller note (typical in CPA firm sales).
• Financing Structure: We plan to utilize SBA 7(a) loans to finance the majority of each acquisition. SBA loans can fund ~75–90% of business acquisitions at favorable terms (currently ~10-year term, ~7–8% interest). For example, a $2M acquisition could be funded with ~$1.6–$1.8M SBA debt and the rest in buyer equity/seller financing. Across $5M of acquisitions, we might inject roughly $1M (20%) equity and finance $4M via SBA loans. The cash flow of the acquired firms (with integration synergies) should be sufficient to service the debt, given typical CPA firm profit margins of 20%+. We will also negotiate seller financing (promissory notes to the sellers) for perhaps 10–20% of each deal, further reducing upfront cash needs and aligning the seller in a successful transition.
• Working Capital: We will reserve around $250k–$500k of working capital to cover integration costs, technology investments, and any initial operating losses or client attrition. This includes funds for software purchases, potential employee recruiting bonuses, marketing rebrand costs, and so on. Because we are leveraging SBA debt, we need to ensure the firms maintain healthy cash flow – thus having extra cushion is prudent to cover loan payments in the early months before full efficiency kicks in.
• Tech and Integration Investment: As noted, about $50–100k is allocated to technology (software licenses, hardware upgrades, possibly hiring a consultant to set up systems). This is a one-time or first-year cost and can be funded from the working capital above or additionally budgeted.
• Contingency for Client Retention: If some clients are lost post-acquisition (churn), we may need funds to either replace that revenue via marketing or adjust staffing. Our budget assumes a small client attrition (maybe 5–10% of revenues) which is common when firms change hands; we have built that into our pro formas. The goal is to mitigate churn (see Risk section) so that it doesn’t significantly affect cash flow available for debt service.
Overall, the financial model shows that with ~$5M deployed, we can assemble ~ $4–5M/year in revenue by year 2. With efficiency improvements, we target increasing the net profit margin from perhaps 15–20% (industry norm for small firms) to 25%+ through tech and centralization, which would produce over $1M in EBITDA. This not only comfortably covers loan servicing (~$500k/year perhaps) but also positions us for reinvestment and growth. We also anticipate revenue growth from new clients in the acquired regions, which could further improve the ROI. In a successful case, the HOA vertical could double its revenue (to ~$8–10M) in a 5-year horizon with additional minor acquisitions and organic growth, all funded through internal cash flows after the initial $5M investment.
The use of debt financing (SBA) is intentional – it allows us to achieve scale with limited equity, thus maximizing returns on equity and preserving dilution. The SBA route does require personal guarantees and collateral, but given the stable nature of HOA clients and recurring work, we view the risk as manageable. Moreover, the fragmented CPA market means there’s an opportunity to buy firms at reasonable multiples (1× revenue is much lower than typical tech or other service businesses), capturing synergy by rolling them up.
To summarize resources: - People: ~5 full-time professionals initially, scaling to ~10+ as we add firms (plus shared resources). - Systems: a modern suite of audit software, client portal, and practice management tools (budgeted low six-figures). - Time: ~3–5 months for first deal/integration, ~18 months to assemble multi-firm platform and refine it. - Money: up to $5M investment (mix of debt and equity) to achieve critical mass, with strong confidence in payback given the recurring nature of revenues.

## 5. Risk Factors and Mitigation Strategies
Like any investment and expansion plan, this strategy carries risks that must be addressed. Below we identify the key risk factors – client retention, staff capacity, and professional liability – and how we plan to mitigate each:
• Client Churn and Retention Risk: When acquiring small CPA firms, there is always a risk that some clients (especially HOA boards who may have personal loyalty to the selling CPA) will leave due to the change in ownership or new processes. HOAs may solicit new bids if they perceive a disruption or if fees increase. Mitigation: We will work hard to retain acquired clients through a high-touch transition. This means having the seller/previous owner endorse Bursar to the clients and possibly remain involved through the first audit/review cycle as an advisor. We’ll send joint communication to all HOA boards explaining the benefits of the new Bursar platform (more resources, better technology, continuity of staff) to set a positive tone. Pricing will be kept consistent in year 1 for acquired clients – no sudden fee hikes. Additionally, by improving service (e.g. faster turnaround, useful management reports) we aim to delight the clients so they have no reason to switch. We will also use non-compete and non-solicit clauses in purchase agreements to ensure the seller doesn’t poach clients back or that key employees don’t leave to compete. In case a client does leave, our pipeline of new HOA clients (through marketing and referrals) should replace lost revenue – but our primary goal is >90% retention. High client stickiness in this niche is expected if service quality remains high, because boards prefer to not spend time shopping for new auditors every year.
• Staff Capacity and Turnover Risk: Scaling the business means we must deliver on potentially hundreds of engagements on time. There’s risk that we over-extend our staff, leading to burnout or errors. Also, integrating teams from different acquired firms could lead to culture clashes or some staff quitting if they dislike the new methods. Mitigation: We will implement realistic workload planning – mapping out busy season schedules and hiring early if capacity looks tight. The efficiency gained from automation will help each staff handle more work, but we will not rely solely on that; instead, we intend to slightly over-hire or contract seasonal help to ensure no single point of failure. Cross-training multiple people on each engagement (e.g. two reviewers know the client) will allow substitution if someone is unavailable. To retain staff, we’ll invest in training and offer a clear career path in this growing platform, as well as competitive compensation (possibly equity in the platform for key leaders). The Bursar culture is intended to be innovative and tech-forward, which may actually attract younger accountants who see this as more exciting than a traditional small firm. We’ll also carefully manage the integration process: involve acquired staff in decisions, avoid forcing overnight drastic changes, and provide support as they learn new software. By creating a positive work environment and reasonable work-life balance (even during crunch periods), we reduce turnover risk. In summary, scaling headcount ahead of demand, utilizing contract labor in peaks, and fostering a unified, attractive culture will address capacity issues. Furthermore, our distributed structure (multiple offices) provides resilience – if one office is short-staffed, another’s team can help remotely, smoothing out regional imbalances.
• Litigation and Professional Liability Risk: Performing audits and even reviews carries risk of lawsuits or claims if something goes wrong (e.g., if an HOA experiences fraud or financial failure that members blame the CPA for not catching). HOAs, being collective entities, sometimes have contentious politics, and a dissatisfied member could sue the auditors after a loss. Additionally, as we scale, the sheer number of engagements increases the probability of an error or oversight. Mitigation: We will take a multi-pronged approach to minimize liability:
• Client Selection: As noted, we will be somewhat selective in accepting audit clients, especially. We prefer stable HOAs with good bookkeeping. We might avoid (or only do compilation engagements for) associations that are known to be litigious or have extremely poor records, unless/until they improve. By picking clients carefully, we reduce the chance of big disputes.
• Scope Management: For review engagements, we will ensure engagement letters clearly state the limited nature of a review (not designed to detect fraud, etc.) to set expectations. For audits, we will thoroughly scope the engagement and perhaps avoid non-standard procedures that expand liability without sufficient benefit. In some cases, if an HOA is in disarray, we might recommend an agreed-upon procedures engagement instead of a full audit, to target specific concerns without taking on the broad responsibility of an audit opinion. Essentially, we match the service level to risk – e.g., do a compilation (which carries no assurance or opinion) if the situation is high-risk, thereby shielding us from certain claims (while still helping the client get financial info).
• Documentation Discipline: We will enforce strong workpaper documentation and review processes so that if our work is ever challenged, we have a solid file to demonstrate we complied with standards. This includes internal second-partner review of any audit reports (the Sarbanes-Oxley best practice of a concurring review, even though not legally required for private HOAs). Having detailed documentation and correspondence archived can be a lifesaver in defending against allegations.
• Professional Insurance: We will secure comprehensive professional liability (E&O) insurance through a carrier like CAMICO or similar, with adequate coverage per claim. As we grow, we may increase coverage limits. The cost of such insurance will be factored into overhead.
• Legal Counsel: Bursar will have access to legal counsel experienced in CPA firm defense and risk management. We will proactively consult on how to word reports or handle tricky situations (for example, if during an audit we find evidence of fraud or illegal acts, how to respond and document to fulfill our obligations and limit exposure).
• Training and Updates: We’ll continuously train staff on professional ethics and new accounting standards (for instance, revenue recognition rules for HOAs changed with ASC 606 – we need to implement such changes correctly to avoid misstatement risk). Keeping technically sharp is part of risk mitigation, as is encouraging a culture of speaking up if something seems wrong at a client (so we can address it rather than look the other way).
• Focus on Reviews vs Audits: Finally, by keeping audits as a smaller portion of our work mix (unless absolutely necessary), we inherently reduce liability. A review has less exposure since it provides limited assurance and is less likely to be the basis of a lawsuit than an audit opinion would be in the event of fraud. When we do perform audits, we will likely do so in accordance with AICPA’s Audit Quality Centers best practices for Employee Benefit Plans or other niches – in our case, we might become members of the AICPA Center for Plain English Accounting or similar to stay ahead on quality issues.
By implementing these measures, we aim to keep our professional liability incidents to zero. The HOA niche, while litigious in some disputes (like construction defects), has not historically been a hotbed of audit malpractice suits – especially if the CPA communicates well and the scope is clear. We intend to be proactive and conservative in our approach to avoid being in situations that lead to claims. This disciplined approach to risk will also reassure any investors or insurers backing our roll-up.
In summary, we recognize that client retention, staff sufficiency, and liability management are critical to success. Our mitigations – nurturing relationships, not overstretching, maintaining quality and documentation – are built into the strategy. Moreover, because Bursar’s model is one of long-term partnership (we are not just flipping these firms quickly), we will continuously monitor these risk areas and adjust tactics as needed. The goal is a stable, growing business with minimal surprises.

## 6. Alignment with Bursar’s Broader Strategy
This HOA/CIRA vertical strategy is not an isolated endeavor, but a key component of Bursar’s vision for an AI-native national CPA firm. It aligns with and enhances the larger roll-up plan in several ways:
• Technology Platform Development: The HOA niche provides an excellent sandbox to develop Bursar’s proprietary technology platform. Because we will be handling a high volume of similar engagements, we can justify investing in automation and AI tools that streamline those engagements. The workflows and software integrations we build for HOAs (client portals, bank automation, analytical tools) can become modules in Bursar’s broader tech platform. We essentially embed HOA-specific workflow automation into Bursar’s system. Down the line, these tools could be adapted to other niches (for example, an AI variance analysis engine built for HOAs can be tweaked for other industries’ financial reviews). Our success in automating HOA audits will serve as a proof-of-concept for Bursar’s thesis that technology can greatly improve efficiency in traditional accounting services. This demonstrable tech-enabled efficiency will not only improve our margins but also be a showcase to investors or future sellers that Bursar’s platform adds real value. In essence, HOA accounting becomes one of the verticals where Bursar’s AI and software development efforts concentrate, yielding innovations that benefit the entire firm.
• Vertical Specialization as a Roll-up Strategy: Bursar’s national strategy is to create an “accounting firm of the future” by acquiring smaller firms and modernizing them. A key part of that is organizing by industry verticals to achieve expertise and scale. The HOA/CIRA vertical is a prime example of this approach – rather than being a generalist firm, we form a highly specialized practice with a strong regional presence (initially California) and eventually expand that vertical to other states. This positions Bursar as not just another local CPA firm aggregator, but as a home for niche centers of excellence. HOA accounting can be one such center. After refining the model in California (which has the most HOAs), we could replicate it in other HOA-heavy states like Florida, Texas, or Arizona by acquiring firms there and plugging them into our HOA vertical, using the same tech and playbook. This creates a national HOA accounting division under Bursar, distinct in its brand and expertise, which could dominate that market segment. Similarly, Bursar might have other verticals (e.g. medical practices, nonprofit orgs, etc.), each with tailored tech and processes. The HOA vertical thus serves as a template for how Bursar scales other niches: acquire experts, standardize and automate, grow market share, repeat in new regions. It contributes to the roll-up’s diversity while still benefiting from centralized platform resources.
• Scalability and Repeatable Model: The strategies we apply here (dual-entity structure, process automation, centralized support) are scalable across Bursar. Successfully implementing the dual-ownership model with a California firm will pave the way for doing the same in other states – demonstrating to regulators and partners that we can maintain independence and quality while having outside investors. The lessons learned in integrating firms (e.g. how to handle client communications, which processes to unify versus leave local, etc.) will inform all future acquisitions Bursar makes, even outside the HOA space. Essentially, the HOA project is the first major pilot of Bursar’s integration strategy. By executing well, we build internal confidence and external credibility, making subsequent deals smoother. Moreover, the financial profile of the HOA niche (steady, recurring revenue, low bad debt) will contribute to Bursar’s consolidated financials, providing stable cash flows that can support more leveraged growth. It also diversifies Bursar’s overall client base (a different economic cycle driver than, say, a tax practice).
• Enhanced Valuation Through Vertical Expertise: Having a defined vertical like HOA/CIRA under our umbrella can make Bursar more attractive to future investors or an eventual private equity exit or public offering. Specialized practices often command higher valuation multiples than generalist ones because they can dominate their niche and often have higher margins due to tailored services. If in a few years Bursar is packaging itself for a larger capital event, being able to show that “we are #1 in HOA audits in California (and perhaps other states)” is a compelling story of market leadership. Additionally, the existence of proprietary technology for HOAs (for example, an AI-driven HOA audit tool) would showcase Bursar’s innovative edge, potentially boosting its valuation as a tech-enabled firm rather than a typical CPA practice. This aligns with the broader strategy of being an “AI-first” roll-up – every vertical, starting with HOA, is enhanced with AI/automation to drive efficiency and differentiation.
• Cross-Vertical Synergy: While verticals will operate somewhat independently, there are synergies. For instance, the HOA vertical could partner with another vertical (say, personal financial planning) to offer seminars to HOA board members on budgeting (which subtly markets our personal tax services to them). Or if Bursar has a tax specialty group, that group can ensure our HOA clients get the best tax advice (HOAs have some choices like 1120 vs 1120-H filings where tax expertise helps). Internally, Bursar can rotate staff between verticals for career growth or load balancing. The HOA play helps set up these systems of collaboration within the larger firm.
In conclusion, the plan to acquire and scale HOA-focused firms in California is fully aligned with Bursar’s mission of building a technology-driven national CPA firm. It leverages Bursar’s strengths (access to capital, tech development, strategic oversight) to transform a traditional local service (HOA audits) into a modern, scalable operation. By doing so successfully, we not only gain a profitable business line but also validate the effectiveness of Bursar’s overall strategy to stakeholders. The HOA niche will serve as a flagship example of how Bursar can take a fragmented, compliance-driven market and turn it into a unified, optimized, and high-value enterprise through acquisition and innovation. This will build momentum for Bursar’s expansion into other niches and markets, all connected by the central vision of an AI-native CPA network that delivers superior client service and efficiency across the board.

# Notes On Execution

- Licensing & Ownership Compliance Risks
CPA Firm Ownership Rules
• California (and most states): CPA firms must be majority-owned by licensed CPAs.
  • In CA, 51% of ownership and voting rights must be held by licensed CPAs/PA firms.
  • Non-CPA owners may hold up to 49%, but must be active participants in the firm’s business and meet character/ethics rules.
• Licensed CPA “signer” requirements:
  • Only CPAs can sign audit/attest reports and certain tax filings.
  • The responsible managing licensee must control professional decisions — you can’t contractually strip them of that authority.
Implication for Bursar model:
If the “Bursar Firms” remain licensed CPA firms in their own entity, the CPA lead you bring on must hold controlling equity in those entities — you cannot have the platform legally own more than 49% in CA (and similar states) without a CPA license yourself.
- Structuring the Independent Platform (Bursar Platform)
Why you’re considering a separate services org
• To isolate investment capital from licensed firm risk.
• To consolidate tech, process, and staffing.
• To capture margin growth at the platform level.
Compliance opportunity:
• Non-CPA entities can own management companies that:
  • Lease staff, space, and technology to CPA firms.
  • Provide marketing, admin, and process optimization.
  • Charge a management fee, flat or % of revenue.
BUT:
• Management agreements cannot give the platform control over professional judgment or client engagement terms — that’s reserved for the CPA firm under state accountancy law.
Precedent models:
• CBIZ / Mayer Hoffman McCann PC – Separate legal entities:
  • MHM = licensed CPA firm (CPA-owned).
  • CBIZ = public company management company providing all non-attest services to MHM under a service agreement.
• Andersen Global – Member firms are locally owned CPA firms, with a global entity providing brand, tech, and back-office.
• Marcum / Marcum Technology – CPA firm is licensed, tech consulting arm is a separate LLC.
- Ownership & Revenue Split Considerations
Possible split model
• CPA Lead / Firm level:
  • Owns 51%+ of each CPA firm entity.
  • Retains a base % of net revenue from each firm (e.g., 15-30% after management fee).
• Bursar Platform:
  • Owns minority share of CPA firms (if allowed) or none (in restrictive states).
  • Receives management fees for staffing, tech, and back-office (could be 40-60% of firm gross, depending on service scope).
• Investor economics:
  • Margin growth accrues in platform via fees, not firm distributions.
  • CPA lead can also have equity in platform (aligns incentives).
- Licenses & Regulatory Requirements That Might Apply
Your CPA lead might have:
• CPA License (state-specific, with CPE and ethics requirements).
• Firm Permit to Practice (separate from individual license).
• Possibly PCAOB registration if doing public company audits.
• PTIN & EFIN for tax preparation.
• State Tax Preparer Registration (if using non-CPAs for certain returns).
Platform-level caution:
• If Bursar Platform employs unlicensed staff doing bookkeeping/tax prep under CPA supervision, ensure:
  • Work is reviewed by CPA firm’s licensed personnel.
  • Engagement letters & billing run through the CPA firm.
  • Platform’s role is clearly “support” to avoid unauthorized practice of public accountancy.
- Examples Highly Relevant to Your Model
• CBIZ / Mayer Hoffman McCann PC – Classic example of separating ownership of licensed firm from management company while capturing margin in the non-licensed entity.
• BDO Alliance USA – Affiliation model where independents retain licenses, but tech and process are centralized.
• H&R Block / Block Advisors – Uses EAs and CPAs under brand, with corporate ownership in non-attest environments.
- Best-Practice Guardrails
• Draft Management Services Agreements that:
  • Spell out platform services & fees.
  • Explicitly reserve professional judgment to CPA firm.
  • Include termination clauses that protect both sides.
• Ensure CPA firm branding is distinct from platform branding where licensing boards may object.
• Consider multi-entity diagram for clarity with regulators.
• Align CPA lead incentives with both firm-level performance and platform growth.
- Market Splits You Could See
From precedent deals & broker data:
• CPA firm license holder: 20-40% of net firm revenue (post management fee) + equity stake in platform.
• Platform: 60-80% of gross via management fee, plus any minority firm equity allowed by state law.
• Investors typically target 40%+ platform EBITDA margins once consolidated.
- Market Size: Original: “The U.S. accounting market is around $133 billion.”
Revised: “The U.S. accounting services market reached about $147.5 billion in 2023 .”
Justification: Updated IBISWorld data for 2023 shows a larger market size, reflecting growth since earlier
estimates .
- Industry Fragmentation: Original: “Roughly 45,000 CPA firms exist, the vast majority small.”
Revised: “There are approximately 46,000 CPA firms nationwide, and over 98% are small practices
under $3 M in revenue . In California alone, 8,000+ firms fall under this category .”
Justification: AICPA and state board reports confirm the number of firms and their revenue tiers ,
underscoring the fragmented nature of the market.
- Revenue Distribution: Original: “Small firms account for most of the industry's revenue.”
Revised: “Small practices collectively deliver over 80% of U.S. accounting service revenue (with the Big
Four capturing ~18%) , amounting to tens of billions – roughly $40 B+ in aggregate for sub-$3 M firms
.”
Justification: Industry analyses indicate that only a modest share of revenue is concentrated in the largest
firms, leaving the bulk spread across thousands of smaller practices . The combined revenue of small
firms is estimated at $40 B+ , consistent with their majority share.
- Talent Pipeline Decline: Original: “Fewer people are entering accounting, creating a pipeline problem.”
Revised: “The profession faces a severe talent shortage: over 300,000 accountants have left the field since
2020 (a 17% workforce drop) , and the number of new accounting graduates has fallen roughly 20%
since 2010 . CPA exam participation hit its lowest level since 2006 in 2022 .”
Justification: Recent data from the AICPA and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics confirm unprecedented
attrition and declining student interest , far exceeding earlier projections and highlighting the depth
of the pipeline crisis.
- Aging Workforce & Retirements: Original: “Many CPAs are nearing retirement age.”
Revised: “An estimated 75% of current CPAs are at or near retirement age , contributing to an
anticipated 136,000 accounting job openings per year through 2034 as Baby Boomers exit .”
Justification: The AICPA reports a looming “silver tsunami” of retirements – a huge wave of older CPAs
leaving the workforce – which substantiates concerns about succession challenges in small firms.
- Hiring Difficulties: Original: “Firms are struggling to hire, with positions going unfilled.”
Revised: “The labor market is extremely tight – accountant unemployment stood at ~2.0% in Q4 2024
– and firms report it takes 4–5 weeks on average to fill open roles, with some vacancies unfilled for
months .”
Justification: Employment data and industry surveys show accounting roles are taking unusually long to
staff due to the dearth of qualified candidates . This validates the claim that open positions are
harder to fill than ever.
- Technology Adoption Lag: Original: “Most small firms still use legacy systems and have been slow to adopt
new tech.”
Revised: “Surveys show nearly 60% of accounting firms consider themselves slow technology adopters, and about 43% have yet to migrate even 75% of their applications to the cloud .
Tellingly, only 7% of small firms feel they are fully maximizing their current technology capabilities
.”
Justification: A 2024 tech survey confirms that a majority of firms have not fully modernized their IT
infrastructure . In fact, over 90% of practices admit they are not getting full value from their tech
tools – strong evidence that many still operate on outdated or underutilized systems.
- Service Mix in Small Firms: Original: “Small practices mostly do compliance work (tax, bookkeeping), with
less advisory or audit.”
Revised: “Typical small CPA firms derive roughly 40–50% of revenue from tax preparation, 15–25% from
bookkeeping/accounting, and the rest from other services – only 10–15% from advisory/consulting and
10–20% from audit/assurance .”
Justification: Industry benchmarks indicate compliance services dominate small firm revenues . This
breakdown (with tax prep as the largest segment and advisory work relatively small) validates the original
claim using more specific ranges.
- Client Base Profile: Original: “Clients of small firms are often local individuals and small businesses, and they
are very loyal.”
Revised: “Clients of small firms are predominantly individual taxpayers and local small businesses ,
typically served year after year. For example, many solo practitioners serve hundreds of individual 1040
clients annually (often >60–70% of their client base), alongside a smaller number of business clients –
yielding a stable, recurring revenue stream.”
Justification: Sources note that the vast majority of small-firm clientele are individuals and small
enterprises . These clients tend to stick with their CPAs long-term, resulting in high retention rates and
predictable yearly work , which supports the statement about loyal local client bases.
- Valuation Multiples (Revenue): Original: “Small accounting firms generally sell for around 1× annual
revenue.”
Revised: “Recent market data show sale prices averaging ~1.0×–1.1× of annual revenue for small
accounting/tax practices (median ~1.0×) . Most deals fall in the 1.0×–1.3× revenue range, with higher
multiples (1.5× or above) reserved for exceptional, tech-enabled firms .”
Justification: Analysis of thousands of practice sales (e.g. BizBuySell benchmarks) confirms the ~1× revenue
norm for small firms . However, modernized firms with strong systems and recurring revenue have
commanded premium valuations approaching 1.5–2× revenue in recent cases – a nuance supported by
current M&A advisors.
- Valuation Multiples (Earnings): Original: “In earnings terms, these firms sell for a low multiple of profit.”
Revised: “On an earnings basis, small firm transactions often value at roughly 2–3× seller’s discretionary
earnings (SDE) (which equates to about 4–6× EBITDA for a well-run $1M+ practice) . By contrast, larger
CPA firm deals backed by private equity have been rumored at mid- to high-single-digit EBITDA multiples
in recent years .”
Justification: Valuation studies indicate owner-operated practices trade at only a few times their annual
free cash flow (about 2–3× SDE) . For context, well-performing mid-sized and large firms can fetch
higher EBITDA multiples (5×, 8×, even 10×) when PE investors are involved , illustrating the gap based on
firm size and sophistication.

- Deal Structures: Original: “Acquisition deals often include earn-outs tied to client retention.”
Revised: “Indeed – it’s common for 70–80% of the price to be paid up front with the remainder as an
earn-out contingent on post-sale client retention or revenue targets over 1–2 years . This structure
aligns incentives and protects the buyer in small-firm acquisitions.”
Justification: M&A advisors note that deferred payouts are standard in CPA firm sales . Tying part of the
price to the acquired firm’s post-closing performance is a well-documented practice, confirming the original
claim.
- M&A Surge and PE Activity: Original: “M&A activity in the CPA industry is heating up, including private
equity interest.”
Revised: “M&A has indeed surged: 70+ accounting firm acquisitions were announced in the first half of
2024 alone . Private equity is increasingly active – as of mid-2025, over 50 PE investments in U.S. CPA
firms have been made since 2020 (totaling an estimated ~$29 B in deal value) .”
Justification: Industry reports document a wave of consolidation in 2023–24 . A CPA Trendlines analysis
tallied dozens of PE-backed deals (over fifty since 2020) , injecting substantial capital into accounting
firms. This up-to-date data corroborates the statement about accelerating M&A and heightened investor
interest.
- Case Example – PE-Backed Acquisition: Original: “For instance, a large PE-backed firm made a recent
acquisition in Southern California.”
Revised: “For example, Aprio – a PE-backed Top-30 CPA firm – acquired Kirsch Kohn & Bridge (KKB) of
Los Angeles in late 2024 . KKB, a 5-partner, ~30-staff local firm (est. $5–10 M revenue), was Aprio’s entry
into the Southern California market. On the smaller end, a local Bay Area practice (Chahal & Associates) was
acquired in 2024 by a New York wealth management firm expanding into tax services , illustrating that
even sub-$2M firms are attracting strategic buyers.”
Justification: These specific transactions were reported in the accounting press . Confirming the
buyer, timing, and scale of the acquired firms with reputable sources strengthens the examples and shows
real-world instances of the trends described.
- Succession Challenges: Original: “Few small firms successfully pass the business to a new generation.”
Revised: “In fact, roughly 80% of first-generation CPA firms do not transition to a second generation of
owners – meaning the vast majority of small firm founders ultimately exit via sale or closure rather than
internal succession.”
Justification: Practice management experts highlight that the majority of small firms fail to hand off
ownership internally . This statistic (only ~20% succession success rate) validates the claim and
underscores why so many aging owners look for external exit options.
- Offshoring Staff: Original: “Some firms outsource work overseas to cope with talent shortages.”
Revised: “Yes – and it’s becoming widespread. In a 2023 national survey, 25% of CPA firms were already
using offshore staff and another 12% planned to start offshoring work . (Domestic outsourcing was
even more common, reported by 30% of firms in the same study.)”
Justification: The AICPA’s 2023 MAP survey quantifies the trend toward outsourcing and offshoring . The
data confirm that a significant share of firms – over one-third when combining current and planned
offshoring – are leveraging external or overseas labor to address capacity constraints, which supports the
original point.

# Keith And Dave Exploration Call 12.05.25

[file]

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
Core Points:
• Evaluate accounting firms for acquisition based on owner involvement; businesses with absentee owners are preferable to sole proprietorships.
• Prioritize firms with scalable, process-oriented work, like volume tax returns or HOA audits, over those requiring highly specialized, personal service.
• Implement technology for process automation and improved client reporting to enhance efficiency and client satisfaction, even for technical work.
• Develop a clear acquisition strategy, whether it's expanding volume, increasing service offerings, or a hybrid approach, factoring in capital and marketing.
• Utilize earn-out clauses and retention agreements to manage risk and maintain client and employee continuity during transitions.
• Consider a "program" model where firms adopt standardized tech and processes to scale for eventual sale to private equity.

## 🔍 Summary
Evaluating Accounting Firm Acquisitions
The discussion focused on evaluating accounting firms for acquisition, distinguishing between different firm structures. Andy noted that firms with an owner who has set up a business that can run without their constant presence are more attractive targets than those where the owner is deeply embedded in day-to-day operations. This is important because private equity typically acquires businesses, not individual proprietors, and buyers prefer to acquire a system rather than merely inheriting a job. The ideal scenario involves an owner making money while being less hands-on, allowing for easier integration and scaling post-acquisition.
Pricing and Profitability in Acquisitions
Participants explored the pricing of accounting firms, observing that typical valuations are often based on a multiple of revenue, such as 1.25 times the top line. The conversation highlighted the importance of scrutinizing add-backs to profit and loss statements, as some may not represent true discretionary expenses, affecting the perceived EBITDA and overall valuation. Speaker 2 and David questioned certain add-backs, like "offshore expenses," that appear recurring rather than one-time, indicating potential misrepresentation of a firm's actual profitability.
Staffing and Automation Potential
The nature of a firm's staff significantly impacts its acquisition appeal and potential for automation. Andy indicated that a firm reliant on less-educated staff, such as enrolled agents (EAs) rather than CPAs, might be easier to automate. David reinforced this, suggesting that replacing less senior personnel is less challenging for software development. The goal is to leverage technology to handle routine tasks, allowing human staff to focus on higher-value activities like client communication and complex problem-solving. This approach aims to boost capacity and profitability without necessarily cutting costs.
Service Offerings and Growth Opportunities
The discussion contrasted firms offering high-volume, lower-fee services with those providing specialized, high-fee work. Andy favored volume-oriented firms due to their process-driven nature and scalability with technology. David identified HOA audits as a potentially lucrative niche for automation, suggesting a productized service at a competitive price to attract a large customer base. However, Andy cautioned about the liability associated with audits and reviews. The conversation also touched upon the difficulty of automating highly technical, specialized client work, which often requires a dedicated technical tax partner. The group agreed on the potential to grow revenue by adding services like financial planning or improved client reporting, enhancing client stickiness and value.
Acquisition Strategies and Future Vision
The participants considered various acquisition strategies, including a hybrid approach combining technical tax expertise with automation for different client segments. David suggested acquiring firms to double their business size through increased capacity and better tools rather than solely focusing on margin compression. A significant part of the strategy involves retaining key employees through retention clauses and earn-out agreements, ensuring continuity and smooth client transitions. The ultimate vision involves creating a standardized program that other accounting firms could join, adopting common technology and processes, to build a larger entity attractive to private equity. This approach aims to capitalize on the "changing of the guard" in the accounting industry, where many older practitioners are looking to retire.
00:00 Pricing Business Tax Services
The discussion begins with the challenges of pricing business tax services, noting that many firms often end up fixing client's books, which complicates the pricing structure. The conversation highlights the dilemma of either filing with inaccurate numbers for lower-priced returns or investing more time to correct them, making it a volume-driven practice.
01:08 Analyzing a Firm's Financials
The speakers analyze a firm's financial statement, specifically focusing on outsourced services, salaries, and add-backs. They discuss how expenses like owner salaries and building-related costs are often added back to show a higher net income, giving a clearer picture of the firm's profitability for potential buyers.
02:28 Acquiring an Accounting Firm
The conversation shifts to the hypothetical acquisition of the firm, emphasizing the budget for outside services and software. A crucial aspect of acquisition is understanding the owner's involvement: whether they are an employee or an entrepreneurial figure, which significantly impacts the business's appeal to private equity looking for a true business rather than a sole proprietorship.
04:39 Staffing and Automation Potential
The team examines the firm's staffing, noting the owner's 1500 hours and the presence of a junior partner who is an Enrolled Agent (EA), not a CPA. This indicates a volume firm that might be easier to automate, as replacing less senior, less expensive staff is more feasible than highly experienced professionals.
06:25 Volume vs. High-Touch Firms
The speakers discuss the advantages of volume firms for tech integration and scaling, contrasting them with high-touch firms that offer personalized services but are less scalable. They observe that high-value firms typically sell to private equity, while smaller, volume-based practices are more commonly available for sale.
09:12 Employee Retention and Firm Value
Employee retention is highlighted as a critical factor in firm acquisitions, with a retention clause being essential to prevent key staff from taking clients when the firm is sold. The discussion then moves to the excitement of volume firms offering opportunities to expand services like financial planning, which current owners lack the time and energy to implement.
11:00 Scaling and Revenue Growth
The conversation explores how scaling a volume firm through technology and centralized processes can lead to significant revenue increases by offering additional services. The focus is on growing revenue through increased capacity and offering more value to existing clients, rather than solely focusing on margin compression, which is harder in smaller businesses.
14:19 Valuation and Add-Back Scrutiny
The firm's valuation of 2.9 million, based on 1.25 times revenue, is discussed, along with a high estimated EBITDA. The team scrutinizes the add-backs, questioning the validity of including 'offshore expenses' as a non-recurring cost, indicating a need for a deeper dive into the firm's financial adjustments.
18:37 Analyzing a Boutique Firm
The discussion shifts to a second firm, a two-partner boutique in Newport Beach specializing in real estate and wine clients, with a sale price of $1.6 million. The partners are working more than full-time, highlighting a high-touch, partner-dependent model that contrasts with the previous volume firm.
22:20 The Appeal of Buying a Job
The low hourly rates of the tax staff in the boutique firm are noted, suggesting potential for automation but also challenges in finding reliable affordable talent. The speakers conclude that someone would buy this firm as a 'job acquisition,' seeking a higher-paying role as a firm owner rather than pursuing an entrepreneurial roll-up strategy.
25:29 Hybrid Approach to Acquisitions
The conversation differentiates between acquiring partner-run firms and more business-like operations, suggesting a hybrid approach for the former. This involves having technical tax partners on staff to handle complex client needs, alongside centralized AI and offshore teams for volume work, acknowledging the highly technical nature of some clients.
30:01 Enhancing Client Experience with Tech
The discussion explores how technology can enhance client reporting and overall service for high-value clients, even if core tax work requires technical human expertise. Private equity's influence on firm structure and employee motivation is also considered, as PEO ownership can shift employee focus from equity partnership to salary and work-life balance.
33:10 Targeting HOA Audits for Automation
The San Diego firm, specializing in HOA audits and reviews, is introduced as a potential target due to its cookie-cutter nature and low average fees. The idea of creating an automated product specifically for HOAs at a competitive price, leveraging AI to identify fraud signals, is proposed as a high-volume, niche market opportunity.
38:25 Strategic Acquisition Opportunities
The discussion concludes by categorizing potential acquisition targets into 'Joe Schmo shops' and 'tactical' firms, each requiring a different approach. The team considers the potential for marketing campaigns to acquire thousands of HOA clients, focusing on the competitive advantage of technology and marketing expertise in a market where traditional firms don't pursue such growth.
41:32 HOA Market Potential
The discussion pivots to the potential of the HOA market, with an estimated 373,000 HOAs, co-ops, and tenant associations in the US. The speakers consider how their existing knowledge of running real estate entities could be leveraged to streamline HOA reporting and financial processes.
43:03 Automating HOA Processes
The conversation explores how a firm specializing in 800 HOA audits likely follows a standardized, multi-step process. The team discusses acquiring such a firm to learn and automate its processes, then leveraging their marketing expertise to scale up to 3,000 more clients, highlighting a unique growth mindset compared to traditional accounting firms.
44:20 Tech Disruption in Tax Returns
The speakers discuss targeting niche tax return opportunities for tech disruption, emphasizing the rapid advancements in AI for embedding into new applications. The goal is to develop an AI-powered 'EA' that can process synthetic tax returns perfectly at scale, significantly increasing repeatability while maintaining human oversight for responsibility.
47:00 Human Role in Tech-Enabled Accounting
The conversation clarifies that the goal is not to remove humans but to automate 90% of the work, allowing human accountants to focus on review and client interaction. It highlights the widespread dissatisfaction with current accountants and how a tech-enabled firm could differentiate itself through improved customer service and efficient reporting.
49:15 Redefining Accounting Roles
The speakers discuss the opportunity arising from the 'changing of the guard' in the accounting industry, as older practitioners retire. They propose a model where technology handles the preparation, freeing up personable staff to excel in client communication and explanation, leading to a significant increase in client calls per day.
52:37 Acquisition Strategies and Deal Flow
The discussion broadens to various acquisition strategies, from assimilating clients of retiring partners to bringing services to existing firms. The conversation also covers current market deal flow, the common reasons firms remain unsold, and the advantages of structuring acquisitions with earn-outs based on revenue retention.
55:36 Coalition Model for Accounting Firms
A new idea is proposed: forming a coalition of existing accounting firms rather than acquiring and replacing partners. This 'program' would involve firms adopting standardized tech, processes, and reporting, aiming to create a larger entity with a combined revenue for a future sale to private equity.

# Onboarding Review: Amy and Avi 

12-8-25

## Summary
https://app.spiky.ai/meetings/public/8a3ec6cc-e5e7-45d5-8f1d-41e0c76e7360

### Tax Filing and Onboarding Discussion
The team discussed Avi's upcoming move and temporary living situation in Airbnb, followed by a conversation about IRS website issues preventing EIN applications. Amy and Andy shared experiences with tax audits and filing, while Andy explained that address selection for business registration can be complex depending on factors like mailing location and business operations. The conversation ended with a plan to review Avi's onboarding process and identify potential areas for AI-driven innovations, starting from lead generation through to client onboarding.

### Modernizing Tax Practice Opportunities
Andy demonstrated his modern approach to running a tax practice, showcasing a website with clear pricing and online quote requests, which is uncommon in the traditional accounting industry. Avi and Amy discussed the potential opportunity in modernizing tax practices, noting the contrast between Andy's tech-forward approach and more traditional firms. Andy explained his reasons for listing prices and offering online services, emphasizing the need to adapt to modern client expectations.

### Tax Preparation Business Operations
Andy explained his tax preparation business operations, including his pricing structure ($395-495 for basic returns), client onboarding process through TaxDome portal, and handling of various tax documents. He described his current capacity to handle 200-300 tax returns per season and his challenges with hiring seasonal employees. Andy also shared his approach to managing client expectations by being direct about the limited tax planning available for W-2 workers, explaining that most tax returns for employees are straightforward with minimal opportunities for deductions.

### Tax Preparation and Filing Process
Andy explained the tax preparation process, emphasizing the importance of hitting the "submit" button to initiate it. He clarified that after submission, clients receive an email with a tax prep invoice and payment instructions, which must be paid and signed before e-filing. Andy also discussed the efficiency of his process, aiming to file 300 returns annually, and mentioned the use of Taxome, a cost-effective tool for managing multiple clients. He advised against using the Tax Dome chat due to its limitations and encouraged keeping all communications via email or within the organizer.

### Software Challenges in Tax Practice
Andy discussed issues with his computer and software, explaining that it was confusing him about whether he was the firm owner or client. He criticized the chat function in the software, noting its limitations compared to email features for managing tasks. Andy emphasized that the most time-consuming part of tax return business is document collection and organization, suggesting that a more effective tool for this process should be developed. He also mentioned a software called Stanford Tax that is 90% functional but has some red flag issues, and he offered to help fix its deficiencies.

### Tax Portal Customization Demo
Andy demonstrated a tax preparation portal he developed, highlighting its ability to pre-fill informational fields and customize questions based on client responses. He explained that while the system can handle most tax scenarios, it lacks functionality to automatically compare year-over-year document submissions, which Amy suggested could be an area for improvement. Avi inquired about Andy's experience with Sanford Tax, which Andy found limiting due to its inability to customize certain questions, leading to potential inefficiencies and client dissatisfaction.

### Tax Workflow and Acquisition Strategy
Andy demonstrated his tax preparation workflow using Tax Dome software, showing how he manages client documents, prepares returns, and handles invoicing and e-signatures. Avi and Amy discussed that Andy's approach represents a newer, more efficient style of accounting practice compared to traditional firms they've encountered, suggesting they need to better understand the practices of potential acquisition targets. They agreed to focus on categorizing and analyzing different types of accounting firms to better target their acquisition strategy.
Onboarding Call Notes
This entire client onboarding / acquisition thing is insane.
• Its complicated, there is disdain for the person on the other side- and he seems atypical since this is presented so clearly as a side hustle/
• 300 clients for a solo, side hustle. If he was trying to optimize, what does that look like?
The form is so complicated and the real value is the person is worried and wants to save money - like theres an opportunity ( AGREE)
how does he compete with H&R Block?
never used, but I have used Liberty before and another family owned. You get facetime, and real time questions answered. This is mainly for the person comfortable sending in their docs and asking very little questions.
Like why does anyone use him?
How many of these do you get?
How many of what?
Stanford Tax- Andrew doesn't use it but has a lot of functionality

# Process Review 12-15 Notes

 @Avi Flombaum @David Jette  @Amy 
HOA Returns Discussion and Business Strategy
https://app.spiky.ai/meetings/1c012bf0-27d3-48c6-89c5-e0ed163a76a6
David introduces the main topic of HOA (Homeowners Association) returns processing, referencing previous conversations and notes from their December 5th call. He explains the potential business opportunity of automating HOA returns or reviews for a standardized price, targeting newly appointed HOA treasurers who might want to switch from their current accountants after 20 years. The strategy involves undercutting prices while providing a smoother process and potentially handling 10,000 such returns. David emphasizes this as a bite-sized, quantifiable project that could be scoped end-to-end with a specific customer set for research. Andy confirms his past experience with HOA audits from 20 years ago, describing them as the easiest and most cookie-cutter type of review or audit engagements. He suggests either acquiring an existing firm that specializes in HOA work to understand their processes or starting fresh, with acquisition being the preferred approach to gain existing expertise and systems.

Amy announces that Spiky is recording the call and taking notes, while David considers adding Zoom recording as well for multiple sources. They discuss their note-taking tools, with Amy explaining that Spiky is a portfolio company that focuses on sales-oriented call analysis, providing transcripts, video, and task breakdowns. She mentions they also have another straightforward note-taker running. Andy asks about the differences between the note-taking tools, and Amy explains that Spiky provides more comprehensive analysis including video and task identification, while the other is more basic. The team confirms they have multiple recording and note-taking systems active, with Amy joking that they're nearly outnumbered by robots at this point. This technical setup ensures comprehensive documentation of their workflow discussions.
Tax Return Processing Workflow Overview
Andy begins demonstrating his tax return processing workflow using his friend Christopher Dolan's return as an example. He explains the client journey from online discovery through Google search, website review, quote request, and form completion. The process involves TaxDome for client account setup and job management, with automated workflows including engagement letters, organizers for document upload, and a 'ready for prep' status. Andy shows how he accesses completed client organizers in TaxDome, which contain uploaded documents and answered questions. He explains his two-screen setup where TaxDome organizer information appears on one screen while the tax software (Pro Series) runs on the other. The workflow is designed to minimize back-and-forth communication by capturing most necessary information upfront through smart forms and questions, though some complex situations still require direct client communication.
Tax Software and Data Entry Process
Andy demonstrates the actual tax preparation process using Pro Series software, showing how client data carries forward from previous years and how new information gets entered. He explains that Pro Series is an Intuit desktop product that he prefers over their cloud-based ProConnect due to reliability issues. The software costs around $4,000-5,000 annually with unlimited client capacity. Andy shows the data entry process for various tax documents including W-2s, 1099-INTs, and 1099-Rs, explaining how his experience allows him to know where different types of income should be reported on tax forms. He discusses the importance of understanding actual tax forms beyond just input screens, distinguishing professional accountants from TurboTax users. The process involves reviewing client documents, entering data into appropriate forms, and applying professional judgment for complex situations like early retirement distributions and foreign tax credits.
Professional Judgment and Client Communication

Andy discusses when professional judgment becomes critical in tax preparation, particularly with complex situations like RSU (Restricted Stock Unit) sales where cost basis information may be missing from 1099 forms. He explains how he handles back-and-forth communication with clients to obtain necessary documentation like transaction slips or supplemental reports from brokerage firms. Andy emphasizes his preference for simple returns (W-2 and basic 1099s) that can be completed efficiently without complications, allowing him to charge $400-500 and complete them quickly. He describes his pricing strategy and explains why he avoids overly complex returns that require extensive time but don't proportionally increase fees. The discussion covers how good organizers and document collection tools can eliminate most back-and-forth communication, and Andy explains his vision of having 10,000 simple returns processed by a team or AI systems due to their low risk and repetitive nature.
Return Completion and Client Delivery Process
58:26-01:09:42

DJ
Andy demonstrates the final steps of tax return completion, including sealing documents in TaxDome to prevent client modifications, uploading completed returns, and setting up e-signature processes. He shows how Pro Series generates client analysis reports comparing current and prior year returns, which helps answer common client questions about tax differences. The process includes creating invoices that must be paid before clients can access their returns, preventing situations where clients might shop around with completed returns or ghost the accountant. Andy explains his e-filing process through Pro Series and discusses typical timeframes for different return complexities, ranging from 15-20 minutes for simple returns to several hours spread across multiple sessions for complex situations involving foreign accounts, RSUs, and multi-state issues. He emphasizes his preference for volume-based simple returns over complex high-fee returns due to better hourly rates and lower stress levels.

Andy explains his pricing structure and business model, discussing how tax season is concentrated in a two-month window (February 15 - April 15) that generates approximately $160,000 in revenue, with additional work extending into other months. He describes his capacity limitations as a solo practitioner, typically handling around 300 returns annually, and explains why he doesn't actively market since he's at capacity. Andy discusses the seasonal nature of tax work and how efficiency improvements could potentially increase his capacity to 400 returns, but scaling to 1,000+ would require hiring staff. He explains his software costs (Pro Series ~$4,000-5,000, TaxDome ~$1,000-1,500 annually) and discusses the price-conscious nature of some accountants when selecting software. The conversation touches on client acquisition costs (currently zero due to organic growth) and the potential for paid marketing if capacity allowed.
Software Integration and Document Collection Challenges

The discussion focuses on software integration challenges, particularly comparing TaxDome with Stanford Tax for document collection. Andy explains that Stanford Tax can read Pro Series data files and automatically generate client requests based on prior year returns, creating smart forms that ask for specific documents the client used previously. However, Stanford Tax's inflexibility in customizing questions was a deal-breaker for Andy. TaxDome doesn't integrate directly with tax software, requiring manual organizer setup each year. Andy demonstrates how Pro Series creates data files that Stanford Tax can interpret to pull exact document names and create targeted client requests. The conversation explores how better document collection tools could significantly improve efficiency by eliminating back-and-forth communication and ensuring complete information before the accountant begins work. This represents a key area where technology could enhance the tax preparation workflow.
Client Acquisition and Business Expansion Opportunities

David and Amy explore Andy's client acquisition methods and potential for business expansion. Andy explains he currently has zero client acquisition costs, relying on organic growth through Google search results and reviews in New York City. Due to capacity constraints at 300 returns annually, he doesn't actively market but speculates that paid advertising could significantly increase demand. The discussion covers potential referral programs and the scalability challenges of a solo practice. Andy expresses interest in hiring staff and discusses his additional CFP (Certified Financial Planner) license and registered investment advisory (RIA) setup, which he maintains but doesn't actively use due to compliance complexities. He explains the potential for combining tax services with financial planning and advisory services, noting that tax-fluent financial advisors have a competitive advantage. The conversation explores how his existing client base of 300-400 people could provide a foundation for expanded financial services, potentially generating significant additional revenue through asset management fees.
Business Tax Returns and Additional Services

Andy discusses his limited involvement with business tax returns and additional services, explaining that he handles some business returns but charges higher fees (around $1,000/month) for comprehensive services including QuickBooks management, tax preparation, and payroll questions. He mentions the challenges with payroll service providers like Gusto and Paychex, describing frequent errors and poor customer service. The conversation shifts to audit representation, which Andy explicitly excludes from his services, referring clients to tax controversy specialists for IRS audits or complex tax issues. He explains the difference between simple information requests (which he handles) and full audits (which require specialized expertise). Andy notes he's never had a client undergo a full IRS examination, attributing this to working with simpler returns and middle-income clients rather than high-income individuals or complex business owners who are more likely to be audited.

most modern HOA (Homeowner Association) software is specifically designed to help generate financial reports, including the data needed for annual reports.
These platforms centralize financial data, automate tasks, and provide built-in reporting tools that make it easier to maintain transparency and meet financial reporting requirements.
How HOA Software Helps with Annual Reports
• Automated Data Management: The software automates routine tasks such as collecting dues, tracking expenses, and paying vendors. This ensures that financial data is consistently and accurately recorded throughout the year, which is crucial for end-of-year reporting and audits.
• Built-in Reporting Tools: Most HOA software solutions include a suite of standard financial reports that can be generated automatically, such as balance sheets, income statements, cash flow analyses, and budget-to-actual comparisons.
• Data Accuracy and Transparency: By using a dedicated system, HOAs can reduce manual data entry errors associated with using basic spreadsheets or generic accounting software not tailored for HOA needs. This accuracy promotes financial transparency, building trust with homeowners.
• Accessibility for Board Members: Many solutions are cloud-based and offer online portals, allowing board members to access real-time financial data and run reports whenever needed.
• Document Management: These platforms often provide centralized document storage for all relevant financial records, invoices, and contracts, making it easy to compile all necessary information for an annual audit or review.
Reddit Insights on HOA Software
Discussions on Reddit often highlight a transition from manual, error-prone methods (like using a mix of Excel and Word) to integrated software solutions. Users generally agree that while some HOAs still rely on basic tools, the dedicated HOA software solutions significantly simplify the reporting process and overall financial management.
Examples of mentioned software include Buildium, PayHOA, Smartwebs, CINC Systems, and general tools like QuickBooks (though the latter may require more customization for HOA-specific needs).

# HOA Audit Requirements: What Every Board Needs to Know
[Image]
Jun 9, 2025
[Image]
Managing a Homeowners Association (HOA) involves more than just collecting dues and maintaining the property. It also means ensuring that the community’s finances are accurate, transparent, and compliant with state regulations. This is where understanding HOA audit requirements becomes essential.
Whether you're a board member, treasurer, or property manager, knowing when and why an audit is required can protect your community, build trust with homeowners, and prevent costly penalties. At Dimov Audit, we’ve helped HOAs of all sizes navigate this process with clarity and confidence.
Here’s your complete guide to HOA audit requirements—what triggers an audit, how to prepare, and why partnering with an experienced CPA firm matters.

# What Is an HOA Audit?
An HOA audit is a professional, independent review of a homeowners association’s financial statements, accounting procedures, and internal controls. It ensures that financial records are accurate, complete, and in compliance with both governing documents and applicable state laws.
Unlike an informal review or compilation, an audit provides the highest level of assurance that your HOA’s financial statements are free from material misstatement.
Here’s how an audit differs from other financial engagements:
• Audit: Comprehensive examination with opinion from a CPA.
• Review: Limited scope, mainly analytical procedures and inquiry.
• Compilation: Presentation of financials without assurance.
If your HOA is experiencing financial growth, internal turnover, or increased homeowner scrutiny, an audit may be the best option—even if not required by law.

# When Is an HOA Audit Required?
HOA audit requirements vary depending on several factors, including state laws, the community’s governing documents, and board policies. Here are the most common triggers:
• State Statutes: Some states mandate audits for HOAs with annual revenues above a specific threshold.
• Governing Documents: Bylaws or CC&Rs may require annual audits regardless of revenue.
• Board Discretion: Boards can vote to conduct an audit for transparency or internal control purposes.
• Owner Request: In some states, a majority of homeowners can petition for an audit.
Dimov Audit helps HOA boards determine whether an audit is legally required and provides guidance based on both statutory and operational needs.

# State-Specific HOA Audit Requirements
Because HOA laws vary widely by state, it’s important to understand what applies in your jurisdiction. Here are examples of state-specific audit triggers:
• California: Civil Code Section 5305 requires a financial review by a CPA annually if revenues exceed $75,000.
• Florida: HOAs with annual revenues of $500,000 or more must prepare audited financial statements.
• Texas: No mandatory audit requirement unless specified in governing documents.
• Arizona: A CPA must review or audit finances upon petition by a majority of homeowners.
Regardless of the state, Dimov Audit offers multi-jurisdictional expertise to ensure your HOA remains compliant and well-informed.

# Why HOA Audits Matter
Audits aren’t just about satisfying legal requirements. They offer tangible benefits for HOA boards and the communities they serve. Here’s why an audit is worth the investment:
• Improved Transparency: Homeowners gain confidence knowing that finances are independently verified.
• Fraud Prevention: Audits uncover red flags and discourage misuse of funds.
• Stronger Governance: Identifies areas for improving internal controls and compliance.
• Dispute Resolution: Clarifies financial accuracy during board transitions or homeowner conflicts.
• Funding Opportunities: Helps meet lender or insurer requirements for financial integrity.
An audit sends a strong message: your board is committed to accountability and sound fiscal management.

# What an HOA Audit Includes
An HOA audit is a detailed process, but with the right preparation and expert support, it doesn’t have to be stressful. Here’s what an audit typically includes:
• Engagement Letter: Outlines the audit scope, responsibilities, and deliverables.
• Planning and Risk Assessment: Auditors evaluate risks based on revenue sources, controls, and past issues.
• Fieldwork: Detailed testing of transactions, bank reconciliations, reserve accounts, and vendor payments.
• Internal Control Review: Identifies gaps in financial processes and recommends improvements.
• Audit Report: Provides an opinion on whether financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.
At Dimov Audit, we tailor our audits to the size and complexity of your HOA, ensuring efficiency and compliance at every step.

# Documents Needed for an HOA Audit
Proper documentation is essential for a successful audit. Here are the key documents your CPA firm will likely request:
• Balance Sheets and Income Statements
• General Ledger and Trial Balance
• Bank Statements and Reconciliations
• Reserve Fund Reports
• Budget and Variance Reports
• Vendor Contracts and Invoices
• Board Meeting Minutes
• Governing Documents (Bylaws, CC&Rs)
• Prior Year Audit Reports (if applicable)
Organizing these materials in advance will streamline the audit process and reduce delays.

# Common Red Flags in HOA Finances
During an audit, certain financial practices often raise concerns. Understanding these red flags can help boards proactively address issues:
• Lack of Segregation of Duties: One person controls too many financial functions.
• Unauthorized Transactions: Expenses not approved by the board or outside the budget.
• Missing Reserve Contributions: Failing to fund reserves as required by governing documents.
• Late or Incomplete Bank Reconciliations: Increases risk of error or fraud.
• Unrecorded Assessments: Assessments not properly invoiced or reported as receivables.
Dimov Audit helps identify and correct these problems before they become liabilities.

# Choosing the Right CPA Firm for Your HOA Audit
Not all CPAs are equipped to handle HOA audits. You need a firm that understands the unique legal, financial, and operational requirements of community associations.
Here’s what to look for when selecting an audit partner:
• Experience with HOAs: Choose a firm that specializes in homeowner associations and community management.
• Knowledge of State Law: Your CPA should be familiar with HOA statutes in your jurisdiction.
• Transparent Process: Clear timelines, communication, and expectations from start to finish.
• Fixed Fees and No Surprises: Flat-rate pricing with no hidden costs.
• Responsive Service: Boards and management companies need fast, clear answers during an audit.
Dimov Audit offers all of this—and more. With hundreds of HOA audits completed nationwide, we bring deep knowledge, efficiency, and integrity to every engagement.

# How Often Should HOAs Be Audited?
Even if not legally required annually, it’s good governance to audit your HOA at least every 1–3 years. This cadence supports:
• Regular Financial Health Checks
• Transparency for Homeowners
• Compliance with Lenders or Insurers
• Preparation for Capital Projects or Assessments
Regular audits reduce the risk of surprises and demonstrate strong financial stewardship to your community.

# What to Expect After the Audit
Once your HOA audit is complete, the board receives:
• An Audit Report: Includes the CPA’s opinion on the financial statements.
• Findings and Recommendations: Suggestions to improve financial procedures or correct issues.
• Supporting Schedules: Details on reserves, assessments, and expenditures.
Boards should review these results during a meeting and, when appropriate, share summaries with homeowners. Dimov Audit helps translate technical results into clear, actionable insights for the board and the broader community.

# Stay Compliant, Earn Trust
Understanding HOA audit requirements is about more than compliance—it’s about building trust, protecting assets, and making informed decisions for your community. Whether you're responding to a legal requirement or proactively seeking assurance, a professional audit adds credibility and peace of mind.
At Dimov Audit, we know how to navigate the complexities of HOA audits. Our team offers personalized service, deep experience, and a commitment to protecting your community’s financial well-being.
