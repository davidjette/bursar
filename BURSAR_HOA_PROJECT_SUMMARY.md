# BURSAR / HOA OPPORTUNITY — PROJECT SUMMARY

> **Status**: Pre-validation | **Updated**: February 2026 | **Decision Point**: 8 weeks from validation start

---

## 1. PROJECT STATUS

### Where We Started
We explored a **CPA firm roll-up thesis**: acquire small California CPA practices at 1.0–1.3× revenue, apply AI/technology to improve margins, and exit at premium multiples (8–12× EBITDA). The macro setup is real — 75% of CPAs are at or near retirement, 80% of firms lack succession plans, and 300,000 accountants have left the profession since 2020. PE firms have poured $29B into accounting since 2020, with 70+ acquisitions in H1 2024 alone.

### What We Learned
A deep-dive interview with **Scott Shipley** (board president of a 404-unit LA County HOA) shifted the thesis twice. First, it revealed that CPA reviews are the *entry point* to a much larger platform opportunity — Scott's daily reality is 70+ invoices consuming 6+ hours per batch, 3–5 disconnected software platforms, no onboarding for new board members, no system of record, and growing fraud risk. Second, it showed us the real customer: **the board member**, not the CPA.

Market research confirmed the structural opportunity: **50,000+ HOAs in California**, $52–140M annual TAM for reviews alone, a $1.3B HOA management software market growing at 7–8% CAGR, and extreme fragmentation — no company holds >5% market share.

### Where We Are Now
**Revised thesis**: Build a **platform-first SaaS business** — the "Board Command Center" — sold directly to HOA board members. CPA reviews are an upsell that increases LTV and retention, not the entry point. Growth is driven by marketing and product, not CPA headcount. One CPA partner handles reviews via AI-automated workflows; the platform scales independently.

### Key Numbers at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| California HOAs | 50,000+ (largest state) |
| Self-managed HOAs in CA (platform sweet spot) | 15,000–20,000 (30–40%) |
| HOAs requiring CPA review (>$75K revenue) | ~35,000 |
| CPA review TAM (CA only) | $52–140M/year |
| HOA management software market | $1.3B, 7–8% CAGR |
| Market leader share | No player >5% |
| CA residents in HOAs | 14.3 million |

## 2. THE OPPORTUNITY

**In three sentences**: HOA boards are drowning in disconnected tools, compliance complexity, and volunteer burnout — yet no product serves them as the primary user. We sell the Board Command Center directly to board members through digital channels (ads, free compliance tools, community engagement), with no human bottleneck on growth. CPA reviews become a high-margin upsell powered by AI automation and a single CPA partner — not the front door.

### The Product: Board Command Center (V1)

| Feature | What It Replaces | One-Liner |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Smart Invoice Queue** | Strongroom / manual | Centralized approval with two-signer auth, photo verification, AI fraud flags, mobile one-tap approve |
| **Compliance Calendar** | Guesswork / attorney calls | Pre-loaded Davis-Stirling deadlines, auto-generated disclosure templates, escalating alerts |
| **Meeting Intelligence** | Manual notes during Zoom | AI-generated Davis-Stirling-compliant minutes, action items, searchable archive |
| **Board Dashboard** | Personal folders / tribal knowledge | Role-based views, onboarding checklists, transition wizards, term tracking |
| **Document Vault** | Scattered files / screenshot folders | Version-controlled storage, immutable audit trail, full-text search, retention policies |

### The Upsell: AI-Powered CPA Reviews

Platform subscribers who also need their statutory CPA review (California Civil Code §5305, >$75K gross income) can add it for **$995–1,495/year** — 50%+ below market rate of $1,500–4,000. AI does the analytical work; one CPA partner provides the license and sign-off. This is an LTV booster and retention lever, not the growth engine.

### Why Now

- **Board succession crisis**: No onboarding, no institutional memory, 3-month dropout rate
- **AI fraud risk**: AI-generated fake invoices are coming; boards need a system of record
- **Post-wildfire insurance chaos**: CA insurance costs skyrocketing (one complex paying $250K/yr extra for panel issues)
- **SB 326 compliance wave**: Mandatory balcony/deck inspections creating new compliance burden
- **No board-facing incumbent**: AppFolio/Yardi serve management companies, not boards directly

---

## 3. VALIDATION PLAN — DIGITAL-FIRST

We go direct to board members through digital channels. No CPA partner is required to start validation — platform demand is tested independently. CPA partner outreach begins Month 3–4 once platform signal is confirmed.

### 3A. Landing Page Test

Three landing page variants — all leading with the **platform**, not CPA reviews:
- **Variant A**: "Board Command Center" (full platform — invoice approval, compliance, meetings)
- **Variant B**: "Stop Drowning in Invoices" (single pain point — Smart Invoice Queue)
- **Variant C**: "Is Your HOA Compliant?" (fear/liability — Compliance Calendar)

**Budget**: $3,500 across Google ($1,500), Facebook/Instagram ($1,500), and LinkedIn ($500). Run 4–6 weeks. Success = 5%+ conversion rate on best variant. *→ See supplement: Landing Page Test Plan*

### 3B. Free Compliance Audit Tool (Primary Acquisition Funnel)

A **20-question Typeform assessment** that scores an HOA's Davis-Stirling compliance (green/yellow/red) and delivers a personalized report. This is the primary top-of-funnel — $0 CAC, generates warm leads at scale.

Promoted in HOA Facebook groups, Reddit r/HOA, and through organic content. Anyone who scores yellow/red gets a follow-up offering the platform. Success = 50+ completed audits, 40%+ score non-compliant, 25%+ book a follow-up call. *→ See supplement: Compliance Audit Tool*

### 3C. Competitive Intelligence Sprint

Sign up for demos of **AppFolio, Yardi, PayHOA, Buildium, HOA Start, Strongroom, Ledgerly, and SyncAudit**. Read every G2/Capterra review. Map feature gaps, pricing, and positioning.

This is pure desk research — no interviews needed. Critical question: is anyone building board-facing tools, or is everyone still focused on management companies? *→ See supplement: Competitive Intelligence*

### 3D. Community Immersion

Join **10–15 HOA Facebook groups**, Reddit r/HOA, Nextdoor HOA threads, and LinkedIn HOA communities. For the first 4 weeks: **lurk, learn, and provide value** (answer questions, share compliance tips, be genuinely helpful). No selling.

This builds credibility, reveals what boards actually complain about (unprompted), and creates the warm relationships that make later conversations natural. *→ See supplement: Community Engagement Log*

### 3E. Opportunistic Conversations

Not a formal interview plan. **Talk to anyone who engages**: people who take the compliance audit, sign up from landing pages, respond to community posts, or reach out after seeing content. Let inbound drive conversations.

When conversations happen, focus on: (1) What tools do you use today? (2) What's your biggest time sink? (3) Would you pay $99–199/mo for [specific solution]? (4) Can I follow up in 4 weeks with a prototype?

### Validation Budget

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Google Ads | $1,500 |
| Facebook/Instagram Ads | $1,500 |
| LinkedIn Ads | $500 |
| Tools (Carrd, ConvertKit, Typeform, Plausible) | $100 |
| Miscellaneous (domain, events) | $200 |
| **Total** | **$3,800** |

---

## 4. GO / NO-GO CRITERIA

### GO Signals (need 4 of 5)

1. **Landing page converts at 5%+** on best variant (proves platform messaging resonates)
2. **50+ compliance audits completed** with 40%+ scoring non-compliant (proves pain is real and funnel works)
3. **No incumbent with >20% adoption AND 4+ star satisfaction** in board-facing tools (proves gap exists)
4. **At least 10 inbound conversations** where prospect confirms WTP of $99–199/mo for the platform (proves willingness to pay)
5. **Credible path to CPA partner** by Month 4 (verbal interest from at least one HOA-specialist CPA)

### Killers (any 1 = stop)

1. **AppFolio or Yardi ships board-facing features** that cover invoice approval + compliance calendar
2. **<20% willingness to pay** across all inbound conversations (boards want free only)
3. **Paid CAC exceeds $75/signup consistently** and organic channels show no traction

### Timeline: 8 Weeks

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Landing pages live (platform-first), ads running, compliance audit published, join first 5 communities |
| 3 | Mid-point check: are ads converting? Are audits being completed? Early community signal? |
| 5 | Landing page winner determined — shift full budget to best variant |
| 7 | Score all 5 GO criteria. If GO trending, begin CPA partner outreach. |
| 8 | **GO / NO-GO / PIVOT decision** |

### Pivot Options (if 2–3 GO criteria met)

- **Pure CPA Review Factory** — platform demand weak, but review demand confirmed
- **B2B Management Company Tool** — board WTP too low, sell to management cos instead
- **Meeting Intelligence Only** — ship the single strongest feature as a standalone
- **White-label for AppFolio/Yardi** — sell features to incumbents instead of competing

## 5. FINANCIAL SKETCH

### The Unit is the Seat, Not the HOA

We sell to board members, so we price per board seat. The growth motion is **land and expand**: a treasurer signs up, invites the president, then the full board follows. Active platform seats are the primary metric — always far exceeding review clients.

### Market Sizing (Seats)

| | HOAs | Avg Board Size | Addressable Seats | Seat TAM @ $35/seat |
|--|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| CA self-managed (sweet spot) | 17,500 | 5 | 87,500 | $36.8M ARR |
| CA managed (expansion) | 32,500 | 5 | 162,500 | $68.3M ARR |
| **CA total** | **50,000** | **5** | **250,000** | **$105M ARR** |

National upside: 373,000 HOAs × 5 = 1.87M seats. CA is <14% of the market.

### Pricing: Per Seat

| | Price | Notes |
|--|-------|-------|
| **Platform seat** | **$35/seat/month** | Full Board Command Center access |
| Minimum per HOA | 2 seats | Two-signer requirement for invoice approval |
| Typical land | 2–3 seats | Treasurer + president sign up first |
| Typical expand | 5+ seats | Full board adopts after seeing value |
| CPA review add-on | $995–1,495/year per HOA | AI-automated, 1 CPA partner signs off |

**Per-HOA economics at full adoption**: 5 seats × $35 = $175/mo ($2,100/yr platform + $1,195 review = $3,295/yr total LTV per HOA).

### Land & Expand: How Seats Drive Revenue Growth

Revenue grows two ways: new HOAs AND more seats per HOA. Net revenue retention >120% is built into the model — existing HOAs add seats over time without additional acquisition cost.

### 3-Year Revenue Path — Base vs. Aggressive

**CPA review capacity (1 partner + AI platform)**:

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--|--------|--------|--------|
| AI automation level | 60% | 80% | 90%+ |
| CPA hours/review | 4–5 | 2–3 | 1–1.5 |
| Max reviews/year | ~400 | ~700 | ~1,200+ |

**Base Scenario** — V1 ships Month 9, conservative marketing ramp

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Platform (primary)** | | | |
| HOAs on platform | 100 | 450 | 1,200 |
| Avg seats/HOA | 2.8 | 3.8 | 4.5 |
| **Active seats** | **280** | **1,710** | **5,400** |
| CA seat share (of 87.5K) | 0.3% | 2.0% | 6.2% |
| CA HOA share (of 17.5K) | 0.6% | 2.6% | 6.9% |
| **Platform ARR** (seats × $35 × 12) | **$118K** | **$718K** | **$2.27M** |
| | | | |
| **CPA Reviews (upsell)** | | | |
| % of HOAs who add review | 30% | 25% | 20% |
| Review clients | 30 | 113 | 240 |
| **Review revenue** | **$34K** | **$135K** | **$287K** |
| CPA capacity used | 8% | 16% | 20% |
| | | | |
| **Combined** | | | |
| **Total revenue** | **$152K** | **$853K** | **$2.55M** |
| Gross margin | 72–76% | 80–83% | 83–86% |
| **Seats-to-reviews ratio** | **9:1** | **15:1** | **23:1** |
| Team size | 3–4 | 5–7 | 8–10 |
| Capital required | $250–350K | $400–600K | $600K–1M |

Path to $5M ARR: Year 4.

**Aggressive Scenario** — V1 ships Month 6, strong ad + compliance audit funnel, faster seat expansion

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Platform (primary)** | | | |
| HOAs on platform | 150 | 700 | 2,200 |
| Avg seats/HOA | 2.8 | 4.0 | 4.8 |
| **Active seats** | **420** | **2,800** | **10,560** |
| CA seat share (of 87.5K) | 0.5% | 3.2% | 12.1% |
| CA HOA share (of 17.5K) | 0.9% | 4.0% | 12.6% |
| **Platform ARR** (seats × $35 × 12) | **$176K** | **$1.18M** | **$4.44M** |
| | | | |
| **CPA Reviews (upsell)** | | | |
| % of HOAs who add review | 30% | 25% | 20% |
| Review clients | 45 | 175 | 440 |
| **Review revenue** | **$52K** | **$209K** | **$526K** |
| CPA capacity used | 11% | 25% | 37% |
| | | | |
| **Combined** | | | |
| **Total revenue** | **$228K** | **$1.39M** | **$4.96M** |
| Gross margin | 72–76% | 80–83% | 83–86% |
| **Seats-to-reviews ratio** | **9:1** | **16:1** | **24:1** |
| Team size | 3–4 | 5–7 | 8–12 |
| Capital required | $300–400K | $500–750K | $750K–1.2M |

**~$5M ARR in Year 3.** CPA partner never exceeds 37% capacity. Active seats outnumber review clients 24:1.

**Key dynamics in this model**:
- **Seats are the growth engine.** New HOAs add seats (acquisition), existing HOAs add seats (expansion). Both grow revenue.
- **Reviews are a fraction of users.** By Year 3, 10,000+ people actively use the platform; only 440 HOAs buy a review. Platform is 90% of revenue.
- **Net revenue retention >120%.** HOAs that land with 2–3 seats expand to 5+ without additional CAC. This is the SaaS compounding effect.
- **CA-only.** FL (50K+ HOAs), TX, AZ, and 370K+ national HOAs are untapped. Per-seat model scales directly to any state.

## 7. TOP RISKS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Board members won't pay** (volunteer mindset, HOA pays) | Validate WTP in first 8 weeks; position as HOA expense, not personal; pivot to B2B if needed |
| **AppFolio/Yardi adds board features** | Move fast; our advantage is board empathy, not scale — incumbents serve management cos |
| **CAC too high** (>$75/signup) | Compliance audit tool is a $0 CAC funnel; shift to organic/referral if paid doesn't work |
| **Scope creep delays V1** | V1 is only Invoice Queue + Compliance Calendar — everything else is V2+ |
| **CPA partner can't be secured** | Not needed until Month 3–4; backup is white-label with existing HOA-specialist firm |
