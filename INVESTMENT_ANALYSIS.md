# Bursar Investment Analysis: AI-Powered CPA Firm Roll-Up

## Executive Summary

**Thesis**: Acquire small CPA firms at 1.0-1.3x revenue, apply AI/technology to double EBITDA margins (33% → 66%), and exit at premium multiples (8-12x EBITDA).

**Recommended Decision**: **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - The macro thesis is sound but the execution plan has significant gaps that need addressing before committing capital.

## What the Research Gets Right

### 1. Market Timing is Favorable
- **Succession crisis is real**: 75% of CPAs retiring by 2030, 80% of firms lack succession plans
- **Talent shortage accelerating**: 300,000 accountants left since 2020, 17% workforce drop
- **M&A activity surging**: 70+ acquisitions in H1 2024, $29B PE investment since 2020
- **Attractive entry multiples**: 1.0-1.3x revenue vs. 8-12x EBITDA exits

### 2. HOA Vertical is Well-Chosen
- **Statutory demand**: California Civil Code §5305 mandates annual reviews for HOAs >$75K revenue
- **Large addressable market**: 50,000+ HOAs in California, 373,000+ nationwide
- **Standardized work**: Reviews/compilations are "cookie-cutter" per Andy's assessment
- **Lower liability**: Reviews carry less exposure than full audits
- **Automation-friendly**: High-volume, repetitive work ideal for AI

### 3. Dual-Entity Structure is Proven
- CBIZ/Mayer Hoffman McCann precedent validates the model
- Allows non-CPA capital while maintaining compliance
- Management fee structure (60-80% of gross) captures margin at platform level

### 4. Technology Opportunity is Real
- 60% of firms self-identify as slow tech adopters
- Only 7% feel they're maximizing current tech
- 43% haven't migrated 75% of apps to cloud
- OCR/automation can reduce data entry 70-90%

## Critical Concerns & Questions

### CONCERN 1: The 66% EBITDA Margin Assumption is Aggressive

**The claim**: AI will double margins from 33% to 66%

**The problem**:
- No evidence presented that any CPA firm has achieved 66% EBITDA margins at scale
- Current tech-forward firms with full automation report 40-50% margins at best
- The firm listings in your database show Net Discretionary ranging from 55-80% of revenue, but this includes owner compensation add-backs
- True operating EBITDA after hiring replacement staff is likely 20-35%

**Key Question**: What specific cost line items get cut to achieve 66%? Show me the detailed P&L bridge.

### CONCERN 2: AI Platform Doesn't Exist Yet

**The claim**: "Deploy AI-native platform uniformly: automate bookkeeping, data entry, client queries"

**The problem**:
- The diligence calls reveal you're still evaluating basic tools (TaxDome, Stanford Tax)
- No proprietary AI has been built or even spec'd
- The tech research shows existing OCR "requires 80% manual review and correction"
- Andy's workflow demo shows the work is already fairly optimized for a solo practitioner

**Key Question**: What exactly is the AI platform? Is this a build vs. buy decision? What's the development cost and timeline?

### CONCERN 3: Client Retention Risk is Under-Explored

**The claim**: "High client stickiness" and "90% retention" earn-out targets

**The problem**:
- HOA boards turn over frequently - relationships are with individuals, not institutions
- Andy noted clients often have "disdain" for accountants and shop around
- The boutique Newport Beach firm example shows high-touch partner relationships are key
- No retention data from actual CPA firm acquisitions was presented

**Key Question**: What is actual client retention in CPA firm acquisitions? Have you talked to sellers or buyers about post-sale churn?

### CONCERN 4: The HOA Strategy vs. General Roll-Up Confusion

**Two different strategies appear in the documents**:

1. **HOA Specialist Strategy** (Strategy doc): Acquire firms with HOA clients, become California's leading HOA CPA firm, highly specialized
2. **General Roll-Up Strategy** (Presentation): Acquire any small CPA firm, apply AI, exit to PE

**The problem**: These require different execution. The HOA strategy is more defensible but smaller TAM. The general strategy is larger but less differentiated.

**Key Question**: Which strategy are you actually pursuing? The HOA niche or broad roll-up?

### CONCERN 5: Team & Execution Capability Unclear

**What's missing**:
- Who is the CPA Lead who will own 51% of the licensed entities?
- Who has M&A experience to source and close deals?
- Who will build/integrate the technology platform?
- What's the team's accounting industry experience?

**Key Question**: Who is on the team and what's their relevant background?

### CONCERN 6: Financial Model Gaps

**5-Year Projection shows**:
- Year 1: 2 firms, $2.1M revenue, $1.4M EBITDA (66% margin)
- Year 5: 3 firms, $4.4M revenue, $2.9M EBITDA

**Problems with this model**:
- Only 3 firms in 5 years? That's not a "roll-up" - it's a lifestyle business
- Where's the capital requirement? You mention $5M but the projection doesn't show uses
- What's the organic growth assumption? 10% annually seems optimistic
- No sensitivity analysis on margin assumptions

**Key Question**: Can you share the detailed financial model with assumptions?

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| AI doesn't deliver margin improvement | HIGH | CRITICAL | Need proof of concept before scaling acquisitions |
| Client churn post-acquisition | MEDIUM | HIGH | Longer seller transitions, retention earn-outs |
| Can't find CPA Lead partner | MEDIUM | CRITICAL | Must secure before first deal |
| PE exit multiples compress | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Build real tech IP, not just ops improvements |
| Regulatory/licensing issues | LOW | HIGH | Legal review of dual-entity structure |
| Competition from other roll-ups | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | HOA niche provides differentiation |

## What I Would Want to See Before Investing

### Must-Haves

1. **Proof of Concept on Margin Improvement**
   - Partner with one firm (even without acquisition) to test AI tools
   - Document actual time savings and cost reduction
   - Show a real P&L improvement, not just projections

2. **CPA Lead Identified and Committed**
   - Licensed CPA willing to be managing partner
   - Aligned on economics and vision
   - Ideally has HOA or relevant experience

3. **Detailed Technology Plan**
   - Build vs. buy decision with cost estimates
   - Integration roadmap for acquired firms
   - Realistic timeline (not "Day 1 migrate to cloud")

4. **Client Retention Data**
   - Talk to 3-5 CPA firm buyers about post-acquisition retention
   - Understand what drove churn vs. stickiness
   - Build this into financial model sensitivity

### Nice-to-Haves

5. **LOI on First Acquisition**
   - Proves deal flow is real
   - Allows detailed diligence before capital commitment

6. **Advisory Board**
   - Former CPA firm owner
   - Tech/automation expert
   - PE professional with services M&A experience

## Strategic Recommendations

### Option A: Narrow Focus on HOA Vertical (RECOMMENDED)
- Acquire one HOA-specialist firm (like the San Diego firm mentioned)
- Learn the process, document workflows, test automation
- Build HOA-specific playbook before scaling
- Become the "HOA audit factory" with marketing and technology edge
- **Pros**: Defensible niche, standardized work, statutory demand
- **Cons**: Smaller market, liability in audit/review work

### Option B: General Roll-Up (Higher Risk)
- Acquire any small CPA firm with good economics
- Focus on tax prep volume practices (like the Torrance firm at $1.1M revenue)
- Compete on technology and efficiency
- **Pros**: Larger market, more deal flow
- **Cons**: Less differentiated, harder to automate heterogeneous work

### Option C: Platform-First Approach (Alternative)
- Don't acquire firms initially
- Build the technology platform and offer it to existing firms
- Create a "Bursar Powered" network where firms adopt your tech
- Eventually acquire the best performers
- **Pros**: Lower capital, proves tech before M&A
- **Cons**: Slower, may not generate returns for investors

## Diligence Call Insights Summary

### From Keith & Dave Call (12/05/25)
- **Key insight**: "Evaluate firms based on owner involvement - businesses with absentee owners preferable to sole proprietorships"
- **HOA opportunity**: Andy confirmed HOA audits are "easiest and most cookie-cutter"
- **Volume vs. boutique**: Volume firms better for automation, boutique firms are "buying a job"
- **Risk flag**: Audit liability concern raised by Andy

### From Amy & Avi Onboarding Review (12/08/25)
- **Reality check**: Andy's workflow is already fairly optimized (300 returns, ~$160K seasonal revenue)
- **Pain point confirmed**: Document collection is biggest time sink
- **Tech gap identified**: Year-over-year document comparison doesn't exist in current tools
- **Pricing insight**: $395-495 per basic return, $1,000/month for comprehensive business services

### From Process Review (12/15)
- **HOA strategy validated**: Team agrees HOA is "bite-sized, quantifiable" project
- **Acquisition vs. build debate**: Team prefers acquiring existing HOA firm to learn processes
- **Market size**: 373,000 HOAs nationally

## Final Assessment

### Strengths of the Opportunity
- Timing is excellent (succession crisis + PE interest)
- HOA niche is well-researched and defensible
- Dual-entity structure is proven
- Entry valuations are attractive
- Team appears to have done meaningful diligence

### Weaknesses / Gaps
- AI platform is vague - no specifics on what will be built
- 66% margin assumption is unsubstantiated
- Team composition unclear
- Financial model needs stress testing
- Strategy oscillates between HOA specialist and general roll-up

### My Recommendation

**Conditional GO** - Proceed to next stage with the following gates:

1. **Gate 1 (Before capital commitment)**: Identify and secure CPA Lead partner
2. **Gate 2 (Before first acquisition)**: Run 90-day tech pilot with friendly firm
3. **Gate 3 (Before scaling)**: First acquisition must hit >50% EBITDA margin (not 66%)

The thesis is sound. The market timing is right. The HOA niche is smart. But the execution plan needs refinement before deploying significant capital.

**Suggested Initial Capital**: $500K-750K for first acquisition + tech pilot, not full $5M commitment until proof points achieved.
