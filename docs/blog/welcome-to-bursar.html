  <h1>Welcome to Bursar — Built for California HOA Boards</h1>
  <div class="post-meta">February 14, 2026 · Bursar Team · <span class="post-tag">announcement</span> <span class="post-tag">california</span> <span class="post-tag">hoa</span></div>
  <div class="post-body"><p>If you&#39;re a volunteer HOA board member in California, you already know: the tools available to you are built for property managers, not for you.</p>
<p>You&#39;re expected to manage compliance with the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act, approve dozens of invoices, track reserve studies, run elections — all while doing this <strong>for free</strong> in your spare time.</p>
<h2>The Problem We&#39;re Solving</h2>
<p>Most HOA software assumes you have a property management company. But <strong>70% of California HOAs are self-managed</strong> by volunteer boards. These boards face:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>70+ invoices per month</strong> with no streamlined approval workflow</li>
<li><strong>Complex compliance requirements</strong> under California Civil Code §4000-6150</li>
<li><strong>No audit trail</strong> for document delivery, disclosures, or board decisions</li>
<li><strong>Personal liability risk</strong> if deadlines are missed</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Bursar Does</h2>
<p>Bursar is purpose-built for self-managed HOA boards in California:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invoice approval</strong> from your phone with two-signer authorization and photo verification</li>
<li><strong>Davis-Stirling compliance calendar</strong> with automated reminders</li>
<li><strong>Document vault</strong> for governing docs, contracts, and meeting minutes</li>
<li><strong>Board dashboard</strong> showing financial health and compliance status at a glance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Join the Waitlist</h2>
<p>We&#39;re launching for California boards in early 2026. If you&#39;re tired of juggling spreadsheets, email threads, and disconnected tools, <a href="/">join the waitlist</a> and be first in line.</p>
<p>Simple pricing: <strong>$35/seat/month</strong>. Most boards pay $175-$245/month total. Cancel anytime.</p>
