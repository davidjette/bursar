# Is Your California HOA Board Compliant? A Davis-Stirling Checklist

If you're serving on a California HOA board, you're juggling more legal requirements than you probably realized when you volunteered. The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act isn't just a set of guidelines—it's California law, and missing a deadline or requirement can expose board members to homeowner lawsuits and personal liability.

The challenge? These requirements are scattered across dozens of Civil Code sections, they change regularly, and there's no central system tracking what you need to do and when.

This checklist covers the essential Davis-Stirling compliance requirements every California HOA board needs to track. Whether you're a new board member or a veteran trying to stay on top of everything, use this as your reference guide.

## Annual Disclosure Requirements

### 1. Annual Budget Report (Civil Code §5300)

**Deadline:** 45-60 days before your fiscal year ends  
**Requirement:** Distribute a pro forma operating budget to all homeowners

**What you need to include:**
- Estimated revenue and expenses for the upcoming year
- Current reserve fund balance
- Estimated reserve fund contributions
- Summary of reserve study findings
- Assessment increase breakdown (if any)

**Common mistake:** Boards often distribute the budget but forget to include the reserve study summary or explanation of assessment increases.

### 2. Annual Policy Statement (Civil Code §5310)

**Deadline:** Annually, within 30-90 days before the fiscal year ends  
**Requirement:** Distribute a statement summarizing the association's policies

**What you need to include:**
- Assessment collection and late fee policies
- Discipline and hearing procedures
- Dispute resolution procedures
- Architectural review process
- Current insurance coverage summary

**Pro tip:** This can be distributed with your annual budget report to reduce mailing costs.

### 3. Assessment and Reserve Funding Disclosure (Civil Code §5300)

**Requirement:** Include this summary statement on the first page of your annual budget or in a separate mailing

The disclosure must state:
- "The state of California requires your association to distribute..."
- Current reserve fund balance as percentage of fully funded reserves
- Whether the association is funded according to the reserve study

**Why it matters:** This disclosure ensures homeowners understand the financial health of their reserves and whether the association is adequately preparing for future repair costs.

## Reserve Study Requirements

### 4. Reserve Study Update (Civil Code §5550)

**Deadline:**  
- Full reserve study with site inspection: Every 3 years
- Update without site inspection: Annually in the years between

**What's required:**
- Component inventory of all common area elements
- Remaining useful life estimates
- Current replacement cost estimates
- Reserve fund strength analysis
- Funding plan recommendation

**Reality check:** Many boards skip the annual updates to save money. Don't. Failing to maintain current reserve studies can result in homeowner lawsuits if the board had to levy special assessments due to inadequate reserve planning.

**Cost:** Expect to pay $2,500-5,000 for a full study with site inspection; $800-1,500 for an update.

### 5. Reserve Fund Use Restrictions (Civil Code §5510)

**Rule:** Reserve funds can only be used for their designated purpose

**What this means:**
- You cannot "borrow" from reserves to cover operating expenses
- You cannot defer a reserve component repair to fund a different project
- Emergency exceptions exist but require homeowner notification

**Penalty:** Board members who authorize improper reserve fund use can be held personally liable for repayment.

## Meeting and Election Requirements

### 6. Annual Member Meeting Notice (Civil Code §4920)

**Deadline:** 10-90 days before the annual meeting (check your bylaws)  
**Method:** First-class mail or electronic delivery (if member consented)

**What the notice must include:**
- Date, time, and location of the meeting
- Agenda items (general nature is sufficient)
- For election meetings: list of candidates and voting procedures

### 7. Board Meeting Notice (Civil Code §4930)

**Deadline:** At least 4 days before the meeting  
**Exceptions:** Emergency meetings require 48 hours notice

**Pro tip:** Post your annual board meeting schedule at the beginning of the year and you'll satisfy the 4-day notice requirement for regularly scheduled meetings.

### 8. Open Meeting Minutes (Civil Code §4950)

**Requirement:** Keep minutes of all board meetings (except executive sessions)  
**Availability:** Must be available for inspection within 30 days of the meeting

**What to record:**
- Date, time, location, and attendees
- Motions made and how each director voted
- General subject matter of executive sessions (without details)

### 9. Election Rules and Voting (Civil Code §5100-5145)

**Requirements:**
- Secret ballot voting for board elections
- Independent third-party to count ballots (inspector of elections)
- Ballots mailed at least 30 days before election deadline
- Detailed election operating rules adopted and distributed

**Common violations:**
- Allowing candidates to count ballots
- Not appointing an inspector of elections
- Failing to mail ballots on time
- Insufficient candidate nomination procedures

## Document Access and Records Retention

### 10. Association Records Access (Civil Code §5200-5235)

**Homeowner rights:** Any member can request to inspect association records  
**Your deadline:** 10 business days to make records available

**Enhanced association records** (must provide within 10 days):
- CC&Rs, bylaws, and articles
- Minutes of member and board meetings (past year)
- Current-year financial statements
- Reserve study

**General association records** (members can request but you have more discretion):
- Historical financial statements
- Vendor contracts
- Invoices and receipts

**Pro tip:** Set up a secure online portal where members can access common documents 24/7. This reduces request volume and shows transparency.

### 11. Tax and Financial Records Retention

**IRS requirement:** Keep tax returns and supporting documents for 7 years  
**Best practice:** Keep all financial records (bank statements, invoices, contracts) for 7 years

## Insurance Requirements

### 12. Directors & Officers (D&O) Insurance (Civil Code §5800)

**Requirement:** Boards must maintain adequate D&O liability coverage  
**Minimum recommended:** $1 million per occurrence

**Why it matters:** Without D&O insurance, board members can be personally sued for management decisions. Most HOA attorneys won't advise boards that don't carry this coverage.

### 13. Property and Liability Insurance (Civil Code §5805-5810)

**Requirements:**
- Property insurance covering all common areas
- General liability insurance
- Fidelity bond coverage (for employees or managers handling funds)

**Annual task:** Review insurance certificates and confirm coverage amounts match current replacement cost estimates from your reserve study.

## Compliance Dashboard: Track Your Status

Here's a simple way to stay on top of compliance. Create a spreadsheet or use a compliance calendar with these recurring tasks:

| Requirement | Frequency | Deadline | Last Completed | Status |
|-------------|-----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Annual Budget Report | Annually | 45 days before FY end | | ⬜ |
| Annual Policy Statement | Annually | 30-90 days before FY end | | ⬜ |
| Full Reserve Study | Every 3 years | By fiscal year end | | ⬜ |
| Reserve Study Update | Annually | By fiscal year end | | ⬜ |
| Annual Member Meeting | Annually | Per bylaws | | ⬜ |
| Election (if applicable) | Per bylaws | Per bylaws | | ⬜ |
| Board Meeting Minutes | After each meeting | Within 30 days | | ⬜ |
| Insurance Review | Annually | Before policy renewal | | ⬜ |

## What Happens When You're Not Compliant?

Non-compliance isn't just a theoretical risk. Here's what can happen:

**Homeowner lawsuits:** Members can sue the board for failing to comply with Davis-Stirling requirements. Even if the lawsuit is frivolous, your HOA will spend thousands on legal defense.

**Personal liability:** If a board member acts with gross negligence—like skipping required disclosures or misusing reserve funds—they can be held personally liable.

**Penalty assessments:** Some Davis-Stirling violations carry statutory penalties, which the association (and therefore homeowners) must pay.

**Loss of D&O insurance:** Many D&O policies exclude coverage for "known violations." If your carrier learns you've been ignoring compliance requirements, they may deny coverage or non-renew your policy.

## The Bottom Line for Volunteer Boards

You didn't sign up to be a legal expert. But California law expects HOA boards to track and meet dozens of compliance requirements throughout the year—requirements that change regularly and carry real consequences when missed.

The good news? Compliance doesn't have to be overwhelming. With the right systems and reminders, you can automate most of the tracking and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
