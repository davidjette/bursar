# Welcome to Bursar — Built for California HOA Boards

If you're a volunteer HOA board member in California, you already know: the tools available to you are built for property managers, not for you.

You're expected to manage compliance with the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act, approve dozens of invoices, track reserve studies, run elections — all while doing this **for free** in your spare time.

## The Problem We're Solving

Most HOA software assumes you have a property management company. But **70% of California HOAs are self-managed** by volunteer boards. These boards face:

- **70+ invoices per month** with no streamlined approval workflow
- **Complex compliance requirements** under California Civil Code §4000-6150
- **No audit trail** for document delivery, disclosures, or board decisions
- **Personal liability risk** if deadlines are missed

## What Bursar Does

Bursar is purpose-built for self-managed HOA boards in California:

- **Invoice approval** from your phone with two-signer authorization and photo verification
- **Davis-Stirling compliance calendar** with automated reminders
- **Document vault** for governing docs, contracts, and meeting minutes
- **Board dashboard** showing financial health and compliance status at a glance

## Join the Waitlist

We're launching for California boards in early 2026. If you're tired of juggling spreadsheets, email threads, and disconnected tools, [join the waitlist](/) and be first in line.

Simple pricing: **$35/seat/month**. Most boards pay $175-$245/month total. Cancel anytime.
