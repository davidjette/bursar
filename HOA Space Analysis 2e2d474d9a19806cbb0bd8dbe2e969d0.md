# HOA Space Analysis

Interview with Scott Shipley: 

Summary

### Background and Motivation

- Scott joined the HOA board to address infrastructure issues and improve the community after deciding to invest in their current property rather than move
- Primary motivations included completing deferred maintenance projects, reducing household costs, and increasing property value
- The HOA operates as a small municipality with 404 units across a 12-acre complex

### Major Infrastructure Projects Completed

- **Pool renovation**: Addressed a completely dilapidated, non-functioning pool
- **Gym leak remediation**: Resolved years of recurring leaks costing tens of thousands in repeated repairs and mold remediation
- **Concrete spalling**: Managed life safety issues with falling concrete chunks from garage structures
- **Heat pump water heater installation**: Pilot project replacing end-of-life boilers that were dangerously overheated to 150 degrees
- **Termite-infested walkways**: Replaced beams on elevated walkways reaching three floors
- **Balcony safety repairs**: Completed state-mandated SB 326 repairs that led to Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac blacklisting until resolved
- **Mailroom consolidation**: Consolidated 18 mailrooms into one compliant facility, handling complex post office requirements
- **Zinsco electrical panel issues**: Working to address fire-risk panels that increased insurance costs by $250,000 annually

### Management Company Challenges

- Initial general manager was absent, had poor work ethic, was rude, and committed ethical breaches
- Board successfully interviewed and hired a better on-site manager through the same management company
- Management company's home office provided minimal support, visiting property only twice in two years
- On-site presence is increasingly rare but valuable for day-to-day operations
- Physical threats from homeowners to managers highlighted need for better corporate support

### Legal Framework and Compliance

- **Davis-Sterling Act**: California's governing law that supersedes all local HOA CC&Rs and covenants
- CC&R updates require 51% membership vote and cost $8,000 per submission for printing, mailing, and tabulation
- Multiple town halls and comparison charts needed to educate members before voting
- If votes fail, quorum requirements lower with each submission until a judge can approve
- Current CC&Rs are 20-30 years old and don't address modern technologies like fiber internet

### Attorney Involvement

- Association attorney protects the HOA entity, not individual board members or residents
- Required for major contracts like the Montessori school lease negotiations
- Handles slip-and-fall, fire damage, harassment claims, and insurance issues
- Manages lien, notice of default, and foreclosure processes when homeowners don't pay
- Must draft formal correspondence to homeowners for legitimacy and to maintain attorney-client privilege
- Critical for determining responsibility when damage affects common areas versus individual units

### Financial Management and Software

- **Current platforms**: AppFolio and BAM (property management), Strongroom/Payable's Lockbox (payment approval)
- Payment approval requires two signers reviewing 70+ invoices per batch, checking photos, verifying calculations
- Process takes most of a day and typically results in net-15 becoming net-45 payment terms
- Invoice approval system feels like it should be integrated into main property management software, not separate
- Board members had to submit driver's licenses to FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) for anti-money laundering compliance, though requirement was later rescinded

### Current Software Gaps and Opportunities

- **Multiple disconnected platforms**: Property management, accounting, and payment systems don't communicate
- **Popular platforms mentioned**: AppFolio (most adopted), BAM (cheaper but lower quality), Yardi (comprehensive, includes utility metering)
- Other players: Buildium, PayHOA (mentioned as emerging solutions)
- Major platforms serve 400+ unit properties but lack integration

### Software Requirements and Ideal Features

- **Integration priorities**: Legal communications, resident communications, meetings/decision-making, financial reporting, payment approval
- **Transparency focus**: Make information available to new board members, existing board members, and residents to reduce drama and misinformation
- **Meeting management**: Need Zoom integration with transcription and automated meeting minutes
- **Simple interfaces**: Current systems are basic HTML portals with buttons and scrolls—accounting could easily be consolidated
- **Training challenges**: Even good software requires effective training, especially for less technical on-site staff
- **Documentation and fraud prevention**: System of record increasingly critical as AI makes fake invoices easier to create

### Communication and Participation Challenges

- Monthly meetings are primary information source, but participation is limited
- Many residents don't attend due to mobility issues, multiple jobs, or scheduling conflicts
- Meeting minutes and newsletters available but underutilized
- Facebook groups spread rumors and misinformation despite accurate information being freely available
- Board members improved newsletter to be more concise and legible

### Organizational Structure and Governance

- Board consists of volunteer officers with fiduciary responsibility
- President and treasurer typically approve payments as most knowledgeable about finances
- Director and officer insurance covers board members' personal liability
- Volunteers face resentment, rumors, and political challenges while trying to help community
- Difficult to replace professionals with volunteers where expertise is required
- High attrition: Some members drop out after three months; others stay too long (six years cited as excessive)
- Can only recall entire board, not individual members

### Third-Party Contractors and Vendors

- Property manager's vendor network is highly valuable—quality varies significantly
- McCaffrey specializes in reserve studies as separate contractor
- Management company handles day-to-day homeowner interactions and hires contractors on HOA's behalf
- Board approves major construction projects in open meetings for transparency
- Security patrols act as catch-all vendors, often responding to issues beyond their scope

### Fraud and Documentation Concerns

- Past fraud incidents included office break-in where only invoice box was stolen
- Suspicions that contracts were fabricated when demanded
- Scott maintained personal repository of screenshots and documents to protect against potential liability
- AI will make creating convincing fake invoices easier, increasing importance of systems of record

### Enforcement Limitations

- California law limits fines to $100 per infraction in most cases
- Exceptions exist for life safety hazards (e.g., speeding, property damage) allowing daily fines until resolved
- Limited fining ability significantly hinders rule enforcement

### Insurance and Compliance Issues

- Insurance costs skyrocketed after California wildfires, especially with Zinsco panels
- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac blacklisted the HOA due to balcony repair non-compliance, preventing residents from getting mortgages
- Found alternative lender (City National) during blacklist period
- Master policy includes director and officer insurance for board members

### Montessori School Lease Challenges

- Previous board signed 10-year lease without accounting for real estate price changes or stepped increases
- New board negotiated one-year lease during ownership transition to avoid long-term commitment
- Extended to two-year lease after first year evaluation with new owner

### Concept: "HOA Intelligence" (HOAI) Platform

- Proposed integrated system connecting legal, financial, communication, and project management
- Would include reliable, unbiased intelligence across multi-feature suite
- System of record with verifiable information synced across all systems
- Integration with existing platforms (Zoom, accounting systems, etc.)
- Mobile-friendly delivery, especially for meetings and communications

### Personal Context

- Scott recently finished board tenure after completing major projects
- Decision to join was family-based: both kids in elementary school, time available to contribute
- Wife serves on communications committee, helping reshape newsletter
- Motivated by Protestant/Calvinist work ethic to see things done well and correctly

### Action Items

- [ ]  David to continue researching HOA management software opportunities and governance nuances across different HOA structures and sizes

Notes

Transcript

Hey Scott, how you doing?

Hey, pretty good. How about yourself?

Very good. Thanks for taking the time, man. I appreciate it.

Oh yeah, yeah, no problem, man. I had to help out and I think you're on to something good there. So, yeah, just... You know, how can I help you in that regard? You know, hoping that my experience might be able to at least help you tweak what you're thinking about working on or already worked on.

Well, yeah, we've been... So, like, we... I think I told you this last month, we build new businesses and we build a lot of software. We're just going to spin up new projects and try to... get them to fly. And we've been looking at accounting obviously for a while, 'cause like we're just trying to see where new AI tools and like better software development can like make some of those differences. We found that a lot of accountants do this work for HOAs and doing their reviews every year.

And it got us thinking, like, that seems like a pretty well-defined customer that probably has a lot of problems and probably hasn't thought about how they do that. Or if they have, they probably have options that are less than, like, subpar. So we were starting to dig around in it. And then I... I was talking to you and I was like, wow, it's worse than I thought. Because not only is like the accounting, I don't know actually if that's the main opportunity, but we can talk about it.

It seems that there's a lot of coordination that could be used. And when we were talking about like succession planning and information inside these volunteer, but still like basically taxing authorities, right? Which like HOAs are kind of like that.

Yeah, for sure. Sure, it's honestly, and this is I'm probably like dovetailing. Some of the other things. Thank you. experience, like whether it's around like public banking or the way city governments work. But it's literally just a small municipality. That's what it is.

It's a tiny village. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And it's got income and it's got a lot of the similar problems that municipalities have.

Yeah, so I mean, probably the biggest headache, like you're saying, is when either there's multiple software platforms that don't, Pardon me, they don't talk to one another. So like... you know, oh, we use this for accounting, but weUse this for the property management, kind of like the upkeep logistics, if you will. Yep. A lot of them do like AppFolio is like the gold, not the gold standard, but. I would say the most adopted, it seems like.

and we moved to one called BAM. which is like It's cheaper, you know, like that's the way out. But it is-you definitely get what you think. There's another one called Yardi. Yeah. Yeah, like you probably maybe either interacted as a tenant homeowner or anything like that. But Yardi also does a lot of like, I believe they can even go so far as to do electrical metering. So that's a whole other thing.

aspect of like billing that you know I would that would break out the problems like multiple software platforms that don't really tell to one another um either inaccurate equipment when it comes to electrical or water metering so like not having accurate reads which then leads to false data which then leads to over under billing um and and then on top of that you have the human elements like are is it the board that is like doing everything or is it a board hiring a property management company or is it in some cases like it used to be for us is it an association that has which then helps manage an actual on-site or not even on-site, but a dedicated employee base.

So there's actually like an association. They actually have full-time employees and part-time employees that do a lot of the roles that in my current like anecdotal case is done by vendors that are contractors. So there's no like permanent relationship that has like benefits tied to it or liability. It's just like, there's a, board as its only officers really and then the third party contractors that you know are um doing the actual physical upkeep of the property or the patrol you know i'm going to call patrols an upkeep item because yeah the patrol notices as many things as say like a plumbing vendor does they might go oh there's a leak over here i'm going to go kind of respond to this leak even though they're not a plumber they just kind of find themselves enmeshed in anything property-wide so they're kind of catch-all the vendor.

But yeah, I mean, and then budgeting, um, forecasting, you also have like the way that HOA budgets in my experience work is that you, you have a reserve study and, and then civil code. So like, yeah, you could run a city any way you want, but then you have an over-governing law in the state of California called Davis Sterling that is like actually your, your Bible, if you will, of like what you can and cannot do.

is an association. And also... Sub-category of that. what officers of that association can and can't Okay.

Yeah, I've been doing a little bit since you were talking about that because I didn't realize that... California had that specific act and since then I've done a little bit of research on it especially around the sort of financial parts of that but like it seems like you've got that Bible with David Sterling And so like how, for example,Um, Here, I've got, I've got, I kind of want to lead it through in narrative format, because I also, I kind of feel like you are exactly the kind of customer that we could service for something like this.

You and obviously beyond you, the HOA, but like, Talk about how you got first involved in the HOA. like how you ended up in a position of responsibility what you found when you walked in in terms of like which software platforms are being used, what, administrative processes were there You can include the personal stuff because I think that's a critical part of this because I think that those specifics probably exist in every single one.

They do. Yeah. there's like personal.

You know, and I'm going to say that maybe it's just, I think we all, you, I, people that are, we would consider our peer group generally tend to be like middle to upper middle class, like, you know, generally raised. Like a solid work ethic sometimes like just sprinkled in with like an East Coast Northeast like Protestant work ethic. Right, right. Or Calvinist like not enough. Not necessarily a good thing.

But the times that it does show through as good is when we just...

It's helpful for keeping the dishes done, yeah.

Yeah, it's like we're just, you know, we're in it to see something done well and done right and, like, you know, rising tide to lift all bolts sort of thing. Unfortunately, I think HOAs also attract a lot of people who are power-hungry. I'm saying HOA boards or committees. They attract power-hungry people, people looking to, you know, benefit personally from it, which would get into the illegality and the immoral, if not immoralism.

Yeah. go back to work so that we can move, you know, move up a rung in terms of housing freedom, if you will, like just to, you know, okay, do I make another, you know, $100,000 for us? And then we use that to get somewhere else. Then, of course, a lot of chunk that has to go to childcare. And so then it just became, well, what if we focused on where we are here? You know, we bought low relative to what it is now.

Our property taxes are low. Our interest rate is low. Yeah. What if we focus on where we are and can we make it better? And what are some glaring issues that we see that maybe have gone long unresolved or no one has put a critical eye on it or just even a fresh eye on it and said, okay, how can I make this particular thing better? And that's when there were several infrastructure projects that were pending or unresolved.

There were some that were already underway when I joined. And so it was just like, this is a nice time. Kids are both in elementary school now. You know, I can devote some time to this. And by seeing some areas where we could have cost savings, you know, if projects got completed, it was like, I can literally save us, you know, collectively, but as a community, but also individually. Like I can lower our overall cost as a family, as a household unit.

By being involved making sure these things are done properly and actually executing them. Yeah Just also, boosting our home value. By making sure that like things were just lingering on today Like there was a pool renovation that happens to be the pool. but it was the one pool that was completely It's a lepidated out of order. was not functioning. It was like, that's something I care about. personally and have It's close to me, but it's also just the entire community.

Yeah. gym that It's not close toward you. Yeah. but it was leaking for years and years and years and it was costing us tens of thousands of dollars every time to Repair it after a leak, only to have a leak again. You rip out the walls, do the mold remediation. Nobody was really critically tackling that project. We also had concrete We had concrete garages behind us where there's also a Montessori school, but it like That whole garage was found to have spalling happening, so the concrete was basically having microfissures that then exacerbating the larger fissures and then chunks of concrete start falling.

So from a life safety perspective, I was like, whoa, you know, this has to be handled. So that was a big project to undertaken also an expense to figure out the budget like where are we gonna get the money for this project. And then we had an ongoing, I joined, it was already a lot of resources and money committed. and personnel can be it to a eco-friendly like a pump water heater installation that was already sort of negotiated out of A state grant.

and several other grants. sustainability which is in California, so we ended up being like the pilot project for seven, um, water heater system. that don't run. Yes, they're just electrical. with their high efficiency to replace to replace boilers that in our reserve study had been at. end of life for several years. So we were just like, they kept failing and we had a repair person that had been working with this association for like 30 years.

The boiler's really well, and we just kind of, like, figured out how to just swap parts and kind of keep them running. But one thing that we learned, or I learned, throughout working on the board is that these boilers were cranked up to 150 degrees on their controls to offset the fact that they were malfunctioning in other ways to deliver through the piping that's here, this 50-year-old piping, the adequate hot water for people.

The challenge there is that if for some reason, you know, there's something blocking a pipe somewhere and that just breaks loose. It could deliver 150 degree water to somebody in school. So that was clearly not the way to There was a lot of papering over issues or neglecting maintenance that had been deferred and deferred for years. So it was approaching a time where a lot of big projects There was a pool, there was the swallowing, there was also Termite-infested wood walkways that we have are elevated walkways that go up to three floors in some places.

So all of those had to have the beams replaced, so it was taking that on. We had balcony repairs that were mandated by a state balcony safety initiative called SB 326.

And so us, along with a lot of other Fox Hills condo communities of a similar age, were required to get those balconies right here. I saw that and that was by at the beginning of last year, right? Correct.

So we met those deadlines and what Another challenge we found because one of the board membersIt's a real estate agent and she was aware that some of her clients, sometimes she doesn't live in the community but she owns a unit here. So that's how she's allowed to participate as a board member. Still a homeowner but rents it out. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were putting us on a blacklist basically so people could not get those.

Couldn't get a mortgage, yeah. Good for me. Which really can can put a now why did Freddie and Fannie blacklist you because of these balcony dishes?

so It's like dealing with a faceless entity with them and I guess It's very bureaucratic. It's a large organization. It was like weWe didn't know why for a while, and we kept reaching out to try to find out why, and then we get word that it's largely due to the balcony, so then we had to like--Okay, so is there, yeah, they have a condo status find.

I know a little bit about Fannie Freddie. So they were listing you--Yeah, they were listing me. Right. As being, uh... Out of compliance.

Even though sadly we worriedIn compliance, so we-We're not able to update their system fast enough to get-are now home owners. that we're selling or you know buyers that were buying to qualify. And so we ended up finding and this is City National. that was offering a comparable loan and would still work with us. And then we're just kind of scratching the surface because we still have to get into property insurance, which went insane after all the wildfires that were happening.

So the main reasons I joined were to work on getting the insurance It's lowered. We had Zinsko, electrical panels in all the units, as well as our switchgears, which are like the six main areas that deliver city power to all the distribution areas. distribution panels are also SENSCO so when insurers sees it Let's go on a panel. They know it's old. And it's. falls into a category of fire risk panels.

So they are charged was extra like quarter million dollars a year. for a master policy because of those panels. So we knew, and that was kind of like right when I was joining was whenSweet. We already had the manager. company we still currently have. We had a general manager that was Just pretty awful. Like, I don't know, Scott. be candid about it. He was absent half the time, wasn't like, would just randomly leave.

He just had just shitty work ethic, horrible communicator. and rude with everyone. And just also it was like kind of There was some there were some breaches of ethics there too. Part of my joining was, hey, I need to dovetail manager right away and see what's going on. Speak to his higher ups and see what, why is this happening? And then eventually, you know, he left and then we got, we were able as a board to actually interview with the management company.

company other candidates for that position and then hire the one we have now, has been largely great. And we had one sort of, I would say, legacy employee that was junior And they still work together on site in the office. And what we're finding out is that, you know, onsite is actually kind of a rarity. And it's just sort of a maybe a whole over function or how this place is always on. Yeah. And this was like two minutes companies ago.

Now it's two people. and it's the same managementI've been doing this probably since before I would say the larger challenge that I just could not take gone because it would have probably taken another year. year to two years was just changing management companies all together because you can have a great property manager on site but if they'reYour boss is in our home office. aren't supportive, it's Really tough for them.

And so I've seen some challenges with the people that work here on site, just like looking for support, looking for help. And we had a homeowner thatHey, my babe. Like basically physically threatened. And this isn't the first time he very physically threatened one of our managers, um, and was super rude and kind of confrontational and like, you know, menacing basically. And And you know, finally that triggered the higher ups at that.

How did they actually visit the property? Because for two years, I saw them at the property. twice and the only reason and one of those two times they were here, here was because We had an event about those heat pump water heaters and they kind of wanted the cloud butSo good management company is hard to find. And I think like I was saying, there's just the insurance issues. We also, with the school on property, they had many boards prior, but when we lived here, one of the board members decided to sign 10 year lease with the school not accounting for how real estate prices would change and not building in stepped increases or anything.

So the school was getting a verySweet deal. for quite a while. Mm. And that was another reason to join was like, look, we've got this checklist of Like, this is an issue, this is an issue, this is an issue. We have a management company that seems to not care if we don't get people in here to drive these projects home, nothing's going to happen. And then we also had the mailroom. So for 50 years, we had 18 mailrooms throughout the property that...

Yeah, and then this is... The post office told you you had to have one, right?

Yes, yes. So that was like another... Construction. That was very helpful. Like having to conform to every guideline and, you know, just delivering like heavy metal mailboxes into a 12 acre. complex and making sure you get in there and that like i get it it has to be that way but you know you've got access control you've got security cameras you've got like renovating the room getting it load tested getting like all the calculations and measurements perfect mudding drywalling painting you know um issuing mail keys to all the residents and all that stuff had to happen pretty much flawlessly and it did But I mean, that was those are all things that I just knew I knew We're down the pipeline.

I knew if we didn't get this, our household didn't get involved because my wife is on the communications committee. So she helps kind of reshape the newsletter to be more concise and more or legible. I knew if we didn't get this, our household didn't get involved because my wife is on the communications committee. So she helps kind of reshape the newsletter to be more concise and more Or, um...

Yep. They may be less mobile, so if they just can't get out of their house, they may not be able to come to a meeting, You know, More people working multiple jobs and don't take the time, even though we try to schedule them at a time. that's amenable to the most amount of people. That one monthly meeting is where we download ads everything that's going on. And that's, And people can always reference the minutes.

They can always-Read the newsletter, but I swear so many people. just Then you get into social media where associations like ours, Facebook,The groups come up where rumor and conjecture gets spread about what's happening, even though The actual true data It's available. You know, it's right there. It's free. And people are obviously putting a lot of time into making it. Yeah. is really taking people up on those opportunities And yeah, I think it's really tough.

of complicated environment with a lot of moving parts and a lot of opinions and a lot of egos and personalities to navigate.

So, yeah, I heard a A bunch of different things and thank you so much for walking through it because that perspective of like we care about our community, we are, we happen to be the people who right now have the time and attention and the care. That's a limited period of time in which you have that type of window, right? And... Those are the people who get burned through on any type of volunteer effort like this because either they're dealing with old stuff that can't change or they're just loaded up with it.

But that perspective is exactly the kind of like drive that you want to be able to direct toward getting that stuff done. And then like whatever experience you were able to get, whatever information you were able to compile, you want it to be available so that the next person doesn't have to work as hard to do that. And maybe the, maybe more, there's a lower bar for what it's really going to take to make a difference.

So I heard you talking about at the end there communications issues with residents and like participation in the meetings and the information flow. And then that touches on compliance. Like you said, there's probably David Sterling disclosure rules and meeting minutes and stuff like that. And then you were talking about construction projects, which are pretty complex. And then obviously you've got administration.

and staffing, things like that. Can you tell me kind of where the HOA board It's committees touch on that stuff where the management company is responsible Where there might be third-party contractors that come in on a project basis, how the law firm interacts with those problems.

Oh. That's a really good, so that was gonna be the next thing that we didn't touch on was legal. It's a huge, huge component. And I'm not talking about Like... The responsibility at large of the HOA to just be like the higher common spaces I'm gonna just throw that term out there because it's so handily used and it is helpful to use because That is really where the The bills meet the road, right? It's like, What is the homeowner responsibility and what is the association responsibility in that?

And that touches on, so yes, David Sterling overarchingly manages like a general, David Sterling trumps any, um, I hate saying that. Sorry. Yeah, let's just not even say that. David. Sterling is It supersedes all local property level, association level CC&Rs or covenants. restrictions basicallyIt's, Even if you're on or CCNR say something like if you know you Break your balcony. It's your responsibility.

Well, it's Davis Sterling has changed since those CCNRs were encoded or ratified. codified or ratified, theyThea Sterling still is the raining on in that case, and we would say, No, actually all California. something like that. So that is the question. Is it time even as the management company Yes. Step on the latest data Sterling, They may go to a homeowner and say, oh, you're actually responsible for this.

The homeowner can't come back. I'd say, well, actually... David Sterling says I'm not. And so that there are some points of friction there. Large though. which there was another oneA large project that is still ongoing as we are trying to update and resubmit for a vote because it has to go to membership wide vote. There's very few things that require a certain, a maximum, I would say a winning percentage of membership and re-issuing CCNRs as one of them.

Rarely do we ever get full purchase like a national election, right? you really get full participation. But we want to get at least 51% of people to say yes to something for it to pass like that. And so if we only get 40% turnout. then what we do is we, It costs like $8,000 to print, you know, 404 units. ...units worth of all this stuff and then nail it. And tabulated and hire like a valid company to count it.

But we want to only submit it once. So the idea is by having multiple town halls and multiple meetings, open meetings where we discuss it with membership, we offer questions, we offer input. What? We've done, I was sitting on two two hour long calls that were open to the membership where we were discussing every little nitpicking point about what it should say and what it shouldn't say. How should it be updated to reflect this?

So finally, the step we're at now We hired an attorney to do a comparison chart so people can look and see this is what it used to say and this is what it says now. side by side, you can scroll down and look at these two versions. Once those are submitted, The majority vote, they pass, they get stamped by it. a court in California that says they're law for us. If it doesn't pass, you get to submit the bank And then if they don't pass at that point, you basically keep lowering percentage that is considered a quorum.

until the final step I believe is you can actually go to the like a board member appointed to the board. Goes to the courthouse to adjust says we are We're at this point where we've tried three times. just want these to pass and then the judge can pass them so And even now it costs like $2,000 or $3,000, I guess. So it's just...

That's just to collect consensus on an important change to the rules of the HOA.

Uh-huh. Which is why I think you don't see them done that often because it's such a hassle. Like, you'll see the same CCNRs. Like, for us, there's 20 or 30. years old. So there's a lot of things in there that areStay there. like make sense as rules and they're allowed to do that. The things that don't because you're talkingOn the internet you're talking about, like all, you know, fiber, like-Uh-huh.

technologies that have been that weren't available back when these were drafted. So yeah, the legal side of things is the association as an attorney that basically Their job is to defend the association from white people. By association, I mean not just the board. like the board is just the elected officers that are have fiduciary responsibility to make decisions in the best financial interest of others.

With the membership of everybody, the attorney is there to protect the association, almost like it's a business. Yeah. for city government. So it's like having a city attorney where they don't have an allegiance to one person. they're not supposed to. And their number one goal is to just basically protect the pockets of the HOA and their reputation. and all that. So they only getEngaged when usually it's, you know, slip and fall.

fire, damage to property, for instance, like the the harassment thing right is that a homeowner claimed that one of the vendors harassed them um dog bites uh you need that you know all the stuff that that would or insurance issues right so um if we were going to put in i'm just trying to think of an example or if we were going to do a um an amenity change so let's say we see that there's a structural risk of something collapsing so we go okay well We're going to remain, which we did.

We're going to remain these things because they pose a potential risk to you know, a license, we might consult the attorney and say, okay, if we do that, are we legally obligated to put something in its place or, you know, If we do, you know, like, so there's all these questions around. How do you protect the association? And then it gets into sometimes you consult them because like for instance the lease between the HOA being a landlord and the Montessori school, it's like we have to have Yeah.

Because any contract that, you know, is of that magnitude, that could affect you. So what we ended up doing is my first year, we just did a one-year lease because the school was changing ownership. We didn't know what their prognosis was for how they were going to do ownership. So we were very careful to, like, lock ourselves into another 10-year lease like the person did before. So we really did a critical look at it.

We talked to the attorney. We talked to the broker. We didn't get ourselves into something that was too minding over a long period of time. And then once that was executed, we went through that first year. We went back, you know, coming up on this next year with the same new person and said, OK, how do you feel? You know, are your finances looking? Are you comfortable doing, say, another year? Do you want to do two years?

So it ended up being, OK, let's do two. So I'm not getting into these specifics, so I don't feel like I'm violating any confidentiality or anything. Right. Up to a certain point, the board can vote to file a lien. Well, it goes pre-lien, lien, then a notice of default, then a notice of foreclosure, and then foreclosure. And then the association, if they're the first in line before the bank, which is really rare, then the association can take possession of the unit.

And this happened with a fire that we had while I was on the board. I actually responded to it, which was terrifying. It was a cross for me and it ended up being that the unit had to be gutted and the unit sat vacant for a better part of a year while the owner who had purchased it back in the 70s when it was like, I think for like $50,000. Can you imagine buying a house in LA for $50,000? So somebody who had just a long time been renting it out and then you have to go through process of, okay, like, we as the association have a responsibility to make sure the common areas are habitable.

And if there's damage to a unit, even if it's inside the unit, which normally falls under the scope of homeowner responsibility, if there's an immediate threat to life, limb, health, whatever, resulting from that damage, the association actually, and that's where the attorney gets engaged, the association has an obligation legally to go in and rectify that issue, at least to the point where it's not causing further damage to the communal property or into the surrounding dwellings.

So if there's mold, if there's biohazard material, if there's beams that are structurally compromised, we have to shore those beams at our own expense. But what we then do is we put all of those expenses on the ledger of the homeowner, who's the cause. So that's where you get legal involved. They may hire an attorney. Their insurance may go after the association's insurance, and then it's just a battle over responsibility, basically.

And so it had to happen in more than one occasion where there was damage to something caused, you know, very clearly by a homeowner or their tenant. And then we have to go to that level and basically say, no, you know, it's very clear that this just started this way. And oftentimes we'll have a report from like a fire department, police department that kind of clarifies what happened. And that report is critical in proving who's at fault.

And then it can take a year or more to get the money back. Right.

So, yeah, that's a rare case, but it can happen. So the lawyer obviously has a big piece of this. And I remember you talking about how important it was to collect information for that so that the HOA has all the right documentation, especially because... You're limited on how much you can fine people for individual infractions now. Yes, oh, I heard you. Yeah.

Now it's like $100, and that's it. For that one instance, there's a few exceptions in the law, one of which is if it's a hazard to the community. So if somebody's speeding through the driveway, let's say, and they crashed into a car, you can obviously, you know, the homeowner's car, who it is, or guest could go after the person who did it. But then the association can say, hey, you damaged this side of this building.

We're going to put the damage cost on your ledger, I believe it's $100 per day until you get it fixed or whatever. So there's a few instances that have to do with life safety things where you can find them for more than $100. But in most cases, almost all cases, it's just $100. And it's a one-time fee. You can't repeatedly charge them per day or per month or anything. So that is a real hindrance to the ability of HOAs to enforce their own governing documents.

So that's going to be a real challenge. It's going to effectively deter associations from being able to enforce the rules, unfortunately.

Right. You can't find anyone, so you have to kind of sue them. It sounds like you have to put a whole bunch of work through lawyers because you want to be sure that you're doing stuff in compliance with David Sterling and other types of sort of liability questions. And the board itself doesn't have– it doesn't sound like the board has an executive who can kind of take responsibility for those types of decisions.

Is it like really purely by– By vote, is there an officer who can kind of be charged with the actions of the board?

Are you saying like taking one...

Like in a company, you would have a board of directors who would vote on key changes to constitutional issues and approve core decisions. But you have a CEO who knows how to do things kind of on their own and can, for example, could like... could do a side-by-side of a document without asking a lawyer to do it. You know what I mean? Oh, yes. So, so yeah, You can have associations.

members like do the bulk, if you will, of the heavy lifting. The challenge I find is that because of volunteer positions, you just don't have like the support as a volunteer officer to really like really spend, you know, what I would say Hours that come with the impetus is given by a paycheck to put that time in. And not only that, but to be resented and have rumors spread about you by people that Like in the place you can't escape from.

move, right? So you're usually doing this delicate balancing act of like trying to help everyone while also anger These people over here, but helping these people over there and then do a switcheroo that we're now getting to those people, you know And you're trying to be a politician, but you're also trying to really just to get the work done, if you're honest. You're just trying to get the work done.

And it's really hard to replace professionals with volunteers in a lot of places where professionals are honestly required. Like I was saying, for the CC&Rs, you kind of have to have an attorney that knows civil code draft laws and look at them and double-check them. And you also have to have the association attorney draft correspondence in a lot of cases. Homeowners about ongoing issues because if it doesn't come from an attorney, it looks personal or it looks unprofessional.

Like if it comes from the property management company, that's typically the initial notice of like, hey, you're, you know, this is wrong with your unit. Like the big doodles and actions that the smallowner took or neglected to take. Then after that, if it gets to where that homeowner then comes and harasses the office about it or that homeowner leaves the gas cans out, Yeah. Very, very little, you know, accountability or consequences.

So we just constantly find ourselves in the board role. Like, there is, as part of our master policy, we have director and officer insurance. So that covers the board again. It's like personal liability for any actions they take. You know, it doesn't mean that we can't be civilly sued, though, so like that's why I was saying like you're trying to not piss this group of neighbors off but also trying to help this group because Right.

The attorney also keeps things within attorney privilege that shouldn't just become like within a committee. Yeah. You know, there's also a through line that I think we like to keep because it's volunteer. You have a lot of attrition. People come on the board for three months and then drop out. because they didn't realize how much work it is. And then you have people who stay too long. We had a case of that here where somebody was on the board Six years and it was like that guy should have left three three years Years ago.

because It looked like nothing else to me than somebody who just could not really push control. And they really made it too much about them and too much about their goals and less about the greater That was somebody that I had to butt heads with very diplomatically. Because again, you don't want to, like in large scale politics, you don't want to alienate yourself to where nothing you want to do gets passed.

So you're always trying to like thread the needle, so to speak. Yeah.

So that, wow. So even, yeah, and obviously meeting management is a beast in like any organization. So we got about, I got about 15 minutes of your time left. I, which again, I appreciate all this, this insight. It's so good. The, the, You use software in these processes. You could probably imagine how newer, better software might play in or might actually make things worse. And I wonder, like, if you could imagine how things might might have been better when you walked into the role or been more easy to manage while you were in it in a way that is online, is using database and intelligence to keep these things close to each other, to streamline communications.

What do you think is missing or what do you think is overbuilt and like if you could push a button and have the perfect platform for something like this or What are the platforms that already are in there? What do they do right and what do they do wrong? Or could you just gut it? I'm very interested in what product might be helpful.

There was definitely ones that felt like that that could be trends. So we have like a There's a It's called Payable's Lockbox, but there's this within that Program overarching name was called Strong Room. It's basically a payment approval system for check signers on association boards. So the data sterling stipulates that you need at least two uh, in his report. Or a certain size, or I mean technically you can have one, I think, again, always looking to be transparent and have accountability.

It was like, no, we always want, you know, usually the treasurer or the president Just because the way that David Sterling suggests you should, but also our own culture, was these two people know the most about the inner workings of the movie, and also kind of the budget that we would like to have them And then in that case, it was me for A good portion of it. But the two years was everything. Every batch of it.

...invoices that are managed. So management companies can either be in the finances or not. Some people have a separate accounting firm that just does their finances, and some people have a management company that has internal accountants that handle it. We chose the latter. So we, our manager company had an accounting team that would go through and Look at all of our outstanding veteran voices. Versus process them, you know, basically submit them to the board via this program.

We get like a screen with just like a running list of all the invoices. Then the board member has to go look at each of these invoices. And this could take me like about part of the day is there's There's like 70 invoices, especially if there's a complicated history, like who's paying for it, why, is it legit? A lot of them have photos. that show you like a job that was done in swamps. and trying to be diligent about it and not just clicking I'm looking at all the folks.

photos like did they do this properly like is this you know Is this what they say it was? And then I'm also adding totals to make sure that their invoices are even correct. You know, if they're, are they Overfilling us with all that stuff. So that once those are approved, that It gets sent back to the accounting department. The accounting department then cuts the check, and then it goes to the vendor.

So it was kind of like net net. 15 was the goal, but it always ended up being And he just so that's where the property managed managers have to manage the relationships with the vendors. And that's kind of like, I think, is under appreciated side of a property manager is if they're really good What they do, they have a network of local construction and building related vendors. that they've worked with over time.

And it's sort of like being a talent and having like a roster of people Peace. It really, really matters who they know because not all vendors are creating equal. Some of them overcharge, undercharge. I say undercharge and underdeliver. So they're like, oh yeah, it'sIt's only gonna be this much, and you're against It really gets to the point. Right. Just having a solid relationship base is very valuable and that's what the person that we interviewed and hired and brought on during my tenure.

That's what she brought with her was the experience, This is a program It feels like it should be part of the primary program that homeowners and board members use. The invoice approving should be in, in our current case, Fantica or in Appfolio. We shouldn't have to go to a separate program. And you'll probably chuckle at this one because we had to do, through the management company, we as board members had to get our driver's licenses and everything sent over to the BINZE, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

of the U.S. government because, you know, we didn't want to make sure that we aren't laundering money through an association, right? Like, we don't have ties to terrorist organizations. And that was all underway that happened the first year. And then the second year was during Trump's re-election, 2024, and legit as he gets re-elected. And then all of a sudden, the requirement is up in the air. It was like, no, you're required to, I mean, does that make total fucking sense?

Like now, zero enforcement of people laundering money all around the world for horrible people. And that was part of it. I was like, I want to submit my info. I don't want the government having it. But if it means that, you know, less horrible things happen, go, yeah, let's do it. And then, of course, it was like, no, guess what? They just rescinded it. So now you're not required to disclose, like, who you are.

So that was an insane thing that happened while I was on the board. Frivolous? Frivolous is a great, yes. That's right in the wheelhouse of what I'm looking for. Frivolous may be improper or unethical. It toes the line to where if it were all cataloged and put out there for everyone to see, that would be probably a recall off the board.

You can't recall one. You have to recall the entire board. Really?

Wow. And again, it's not enough for it to be like, it's not enough for it to be like an ongoing operation where you think there's like actual crime being committed. I just think it was ego and it was control. And it was, so basically I kept a repository of all, I would screenshot, I would save. I had that all in a folder on a hard drive. Just if something ever came out of it, I can go, no, I, you know, I'm fully aware of like all that went down, especially if for some reason somebody ever got, The notion of laying something on me, I could pull all of that up immediately and be like, nope, this is everything that you were involved in, you know?

I don't think it's going to go there, but I just wanted to cover my own ass, basically. As I was prepping a reliant report, just because I'm tired and don't want to do it anymore, and because all the projects that I really wanted to complete are completed, I just was like, all right, you know, I'm just going to keep all this data in case I need it, in case, you know, somebody has questions later, you know, or there's a civil suit, I'm just making sure that I cover my butt, so I did.

Wow, right. But like having all of that in one place, like being able to aggregate, So have you heard of pay HOA? orNo, I don't think so. So there's a couple of people out there that are trying to serve this need. You mentioned, obviously, Yardi and and that folio or are really big, they have big enterprise, and you're over 400 units plus, so you're gonna need one of these small, like mid-size or like larger ones.

There's also one called Buildium. Like, for me, the... The question is like, Obviously, it's great if everyone's on the same app. You're talking about a lot of people of varying interests, varying technical capability from different residents to different staff members and stuff. You can mandate certain types of things for staff, but management companies probably have their own applications that they're using.

So... Like, what are the things that touch the board most directly? It sounds like legal and managing the back and forth with legal communications with residents, meetings and decision making, financial reporting and approval of payments that is done at the at the president level. Yeah. And connecting all of those things so that that information is available to new board members, to existing board members, to residents, and making it super transparent to lower the amount of drama and misinformation and maybe increase the efficiency.

Yeah, you're hittingWith all those things, yeah.

Very astute of you to kind of break everything that we was talking about down, yeah. Yeah, I mean, there's a market for that. And the challenge too is just the training. side, right? They have a great program, but if you can't communicate how to use it effectively, you get an all sorts of virtual training. Ideally, even if you outsource to another company to do like on-site training. If you have on-site staff, especially in the area They're not technically savvy.

I think you run into challenges of like just just the learning curve. and ramping up to full knowledge intake.

on how to do something is definitely it can be So there's opportunity there to improve. That's great. Now tell me really quick, just as an outro, your HOA has an accountant, right? And they're the ones cutting the check, but they're getting approval for invoices from your leadership. Is it the same firm that's compiling your end of year review? and reserve study and stuff like that?

Well, Reserve is a company called McCaffrey, and that's all they specialize in is reserve studies. So that's, again, like one of those third-party contractors that you outsource to, just like an attorney in a way. The only thing that is. I would say a company that does two things. is the property management company does I don't care. Day-to-day homeowner interactions and requests and maintenance requests are also, they are out of which flow all of us folks, which are the third party So they hired the contractors on behalf of the HOA and contract them.

Yeah, and have the direction and guidance of the board. Does that include the big construction projects like the post office?

Yeah, so they would, we would, We would work with the manager company in our board meetings to kind of like discuss proposals and review those. and thenYeah. actually approve them for the most part of the open meetings because you We want homeowners to know that that part is transparent. And that's really where It is a little before my time. But I'm a little concerned that it's really hard to know if there is kickbacks.

Mm-hmm. My most fascinating life Stories I've heard and subject is just his association fraud. There's a bunch of podcasts and YouTube channels about it and the examples of real life HOA fraud. And it's also funny that I'm rewatching watching post-war play now, so that's a god. Let's see. these two things together. And there was some pretty good cases that it has happened here in the past. We had like break in in our office and the only thingThis thing was a box of invoices, like that's pretty telling.

Wow. And this is before nightfall. Before my time, but while I lived here, Yeah. who just moved out, but he was one of the original residents going back to the late '70s.

So he was taking money out of there, yeah. And petty corruption.

to kind of know how things worked and I really don't know what the, you know, the motivation to do this was. Like, yeah. I don't think it was financial. It might have been just about power. or I can do it better than everyone else. Yeah. There's pretty good confirmation from someone that was on the board when I was on board. the likelihood is that like a contract was made up when it was demanded to be Yeah, you told me that story.

And it just miraculously appeared. And that kind of stuff is going to happen faster and faster, dude. Now, you can create a very convincing invoice instantaneously. And even people with very low capabilities are able to do this now. Yes. That's why systems of record are going to be so much more important.

Like you could have just AI draft up a real looking one. I mean, jeez, I'm just thinking of horrific things somebody could do, but they could have basically a call center bot that could pick up a call center bot.

Yeah, could do that too. Yeah, so like these systems of records are going to be more and more important. They're probably going to start to get mandated even beyond like the current systems. But now I understand, so you've got a separate company that just does reserve study. You've got an accountant who's doing your review and is cutting checks and is bookkeeping for you and interacting with your management company.

Management company is handing on the contracting and project management and it flows back up to the board for decision making and to settle some of these sort of like disputes around the borderline between common and private areas and responsibilities. It's a lot, wow. But this is such good color, Scott. I'm not going to take any more of your time on it, but it's so interesting. I'm going to keep getting smart on some of the nuances of the governance here and the differences between your HOA and maybe some others, because I know that there's different sizes, there's different structures.

This is a This has been super helpful and I think that like what we are talking about is like can you build an intelligence like an HOA intelligence, HOAI, where This stuff is plugged in. And it is easy to work with. It's extremely reliable. It's unbiased and it can take care of a lot of these problems through like a multi-feature suite that kind of comes back to a system of record which has verifiable information that's synced up with everything.

and you pay for the integrations with all your various people and you try to connect with the existing systems as much as you can and then maybe deliver a lot of this through mobile or like, especially like meetings, like a simple Zoom integration with with transcription and meeting minutes and stuff like that could save people a lot of time.

Oh, a lot of time because I helped with my team just yesterday andIt was like, you know, from a manager, Like I can't do I can't take these notes Wow So moderating, you know, Meaning, you know, enforcing kind of Robert's rules of order and like, you know, handling, you know, what's being typed in the chat and like all the, you know, at the same time. And I was like, yeah, I know you shouldn't have to.

That's it. Yeah. And then I think just like all the sort of separate suites of software. It's not fancy tech. Basically very basic It's just like HTML. You know, you're just navigating a portal with buttons and scrolls and it's like, there's no, there's nothing fancy about it. about the accounting side. So I don't see how that couldn't be just like,Put in. everything else, you know, on their on what the board sees or what the association thinks.

Yeah. Well, thanks, man, for calling. And I'm glad to hear Friday. If you have any other questions about it, please let me know. I will. Yeah, let me check it. That's pretty good, right? Let me see what I got. That is a great moniker for it because as much as it is strangling a lot of things, if us regular folk can capitalize on it for regular folk needs, then all the more power to it.

Oh yeah, dude. There's things AI has... no business doing, and those are human things, but like all the insane bureaucracies and systems that we get ourselves into in order to coordinate with one another, If you can take that load off of smart, creative-driven people and let them do the human things, then you can do better stuff. There's no rule that says for every one creative person, there needs to be 10 people grinding to just make it possible.

It's like, no, we can... I am one of those people that actually thinks that we can use this stuff properly. I mean, it won't be used properly. The incentives are set up all fucked up, but everyday people can figure out how to use these things helpful. But yeah.

We're making a mistake on on the same way that the actually run itself, right? Early 90s internet It's all sort of this utopianist vision of happy people and that and then they got corrupted by, you know, capitalism. Here we are. I don't want AI to be the same thing that it looks like it already is.

It's going to crash, but we'll see. All right, man. Well, thanks a lot, dude. I'll definitely be in touch. All right. Yeah, thank you, man. Good to talk to you. And hopefully we'll link up outside of this too. It'd be great to catch up and get all the kids together. Yeah, definitely. All right, man. Thanks, man. See you. Damn it.

- PayHOA focuses on payments and basic management
- This focuses specifically on compliance and risk reduction
- "Sleep well knowing you're compliant"

**Market Size**:

- 17,500 self-managed HOAs × 30% penetration × $1,200/year = **$6.3M ARR potential**

**Risks**:

- PayHOA and others could add compliance features
- Small market, niche product
- Customer acquisition for self-managed HOAs is hard

**Verdict**: **MEDIUM OPPORTUNITY** - Good recurring revenue but smaller market. Better as an add-on to Opportunity 1 than standalone.

### OPPORTUNITY 3: B2B Compliance Dashboard for Management Companies

**Concept**: Enterprise software for HOA management companies to track compliance across all their managed associations.

**Target Market**:

- 9,000-10,000 management companies nationally
- ~2,000+ in California
- Average company manages 50-200 associations

**Features**:

- Portfolio compliance dashboard (all associations in one view)
- Automated deadline tracking and alerts
- Document generation and distribution at scale
- Audit trail for regulatory defense
- CPA review coordination across portfolio
- Integration with existing software (Yardi, AppFolio, etc.)

**Pricing**: $500-2,000/month based on portfolio size

**Value Proposition**:

- "Never miss a disclosure deadline again"
- Reduce compliance staff time by 50%
- Protect against homeowner lawsuits
- Competitive advantage when pitching new associations

**Market Size**:

- 2,000 CA management companies × $12,000/year average × 25% penetration = **$6M ARR**
- National: 10,000 × $12,000 × 25% = **$30M ARR potential**

**Risks**:

- Long enterprise sales cycles
- Management companies are price-sensitive
- May build in-house or get feature from existing vendor

**Verdict**: **MEDIUM-HIGH OPPORTUNITY** - Higher ACV, stickier customers, but harder to sell. Could be strategic entry point to management company relationships.

### OPPORTUNITY 4: "Compliance Bundle" - Reserve Study + Annual Review

**Concept**: Combine the required reserve study (every 3 years) with annual CPA reviews into a bundled service.

**Rationale**:

- Reserve studies and financial reviews use overlapping data
- Boards hate dealing with multiple vendors
- Creates 3-year customer relationship vs. 1-year

**Bundle Structure**:

- Year 1: Full reserve study + CPA review = $3,500-5,000
- Year 2: Reserve update + CPA review = $1,800-2,500
- Year 3: Reserve update + CPA review = $1,800-2,500
- **3-Year Total**: $7,100-10,000 (vs. $9,000-15,000 unbundled)

**Implementation Options**:

1. Partner with reserve study firm
2. Acquire small reserve study company
3. Build in-house capability (requires different expertise)

**Market Size**:

- 35,000 CA HOAs needing reviews × 30% penetration × $2,500/year average = **$26M annually**

**Risks**:

- Reserve studies require physical inspection and engineering knowledge
- Different skill set than CPA review
- Partnership complexity

**Verdict**: **MEDIUM OPPORTUNITY** - Good cross-sell potential but execution complexity. Better as Phase 2 after establishing review business.

### OPPORTUNITY 5: HOA Board Education & Certification

**Concept**: Online training platform for volunteer HOA board members covering compliance, fiduciary duties, and best practices.

**Rationale**:

- New board members have no training
- Mistakes lead to lawsuits and personal liability
- Insurance companies would benefit from educated boards
- Management companies could require it

**Revenue Streams**:

- Individual courses: $49-199
- Annual certification: $299/board
- Enterprise licensing to management companies
- Lead generation for other services (reviews, software)

**Content Topics**:

- Davis-Stirling compliance essentials
- Financial management for boards
- Reserve funding and special assessments
- Meeting procedures (Brown Act)
- Insurance and risk management
- Vendor management

**Distribution Channels**:

- Direct to board members
- Through management companies
- HOA law firms as referral partners
- Insurance companies (D&O insurers)
- ECHO California partnership

**Market Size**:

- 50,000 HOAs × 5 board members × $50/person × 20% penetration = **$2.5M**

**Risks**:

- Free content widely available
- Low willingness to pay
- Hard to reach self-managed boards

**Verdict**: **LOW-MEDIUM OPPORTUNITY** - Good for brand building and lead gen but limited standalone revenue.
